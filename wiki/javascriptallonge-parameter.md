# Parameter

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about parameter:

## Statements

### And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving / const and lexical scope

- Yes. Binding values to names with const works just like binding values to names with parameter invocations, it uses lexical scope. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00462))_

### And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving / are consts also from a shadowy planet?

- We just saw that values bound with const use lexical scope, just like values bound with parameters. They are looked up in the environment where they are declared. And we know that functions create environments. Parameters are declared when we create functions, so it makes sense that parameters are bound to environments created when we invoke functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00464))_

- Parameters are only bound when we invoke a function. That's why we made all these IIFEs. But const statements can appear inside blocks. What happens when we use a const inside of a block? We'll need a gratuitous block. We've seen if statements, what could be more gratuitous than: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00481))_

### Recipes with Basic Functions / Left-Variadic Functions

- ECMAScript 2015 only permits gathering parameters from the end of the parameter list. Not the beginning. What to do? _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00723))_

### Picking the Bean: Choice and Truthiness / function parameters are eager

- In contrast to the behaviour of the ternary operator, || , and && , function parameters are always eagerly evaluated : _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00801))_

### Yes. Consider this variation: / Making Data Out Of Functions / the vireo

- Given that our latin data is represented as the function (selector) => selector("primus")("secundus") , our obvious next step is to make a function that makes data. For arrays, we'd write cons = (first, second) => [first, second] . For objects we'd write: cons = (first, second) => {first, second} . In both cases, we take two parameters, and return the form of the data. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01364))_


## Technical atoms

### Technical frame 1: And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving / are consts also from a shadowy planet?

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00473))_

> And we can see that our diameter * PI expression uses the binding for PI in the closest parent environment. but one question: Did binding 3.14159265 to PI somehow change the binding in the 'outer' environment? Let's rewrite things slightly differently:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00468))_

```
((PI) =>
(diameter) => diameter * PI
)(3.14159265)
```

### Technical frame 2: And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving / are consts also from a shadowy planet?

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00481))_

> Parameters are only bound when we invoke a function. That's why we made all these IIFEs. But const statements can appear inside blocks. What happens when we use a const inside of a block? We'll need a gratuitous block. We've seen if statements, what could be more gratuitous than:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00479))_

```
((diameter) => {
const PI = 3.14159265;
(() => {
const PI = 3;
})();
return diameter * PI;
})(2)
//=> 6.2831853
```

### Technical frame 3: And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving / are consts also from a shadowy planet?

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00489))_

> Again, confusing. Typically, we want to bind our names as close to where we need them as possible. This design rule is called the Principle of Least Privilege 32 , and it has both quality and security implications. Being able to bind a name inside of a block means that if the name is only needed in the block, we are not 'leaking' its binding to other parts of the code that do not need to interact with it.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00482))_

```
if (true) {
// an immediately invoked block statement (IIBS)
}
Let’s try it:
((diameter) => {
const PI = 3;
if (true) {
const PI = 3.14159265;
return diameter * PI;
}
})(2)
//=> 6.2831853
((diameter) => {
const PI = 3.14159265;
if (true) {
const PI = 3;
}
return diameter * PI;
```

### Technical frame 4: And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving / are consts also from a shadowy planet?

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00489))_

> Again, confusing. Typically, we want to bind our names as close to where we need them as possible.

```
})(2)
//=> 6.2831853
```

### Technical frame 5: Recipes with Basic Functions / Left-Variadic Functions

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00719))_

> This can be useful when writing certain kinds of destructuring algorithms. For example, we might want to have a function that builds some kind of team record. It accepts a coach, a captain, and an arbitrary number of players. Easy in ECMAScript 2015:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00718))_

```
const abccc = (a, b, ...c) => {
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);
};
abccc(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
1
2
[3,4,5]
```

### Technical frame 6: Recipes with Basic Functions / Left-Variadic Functions / a history lesson

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00731))_

> This is a right-variadic function , meaning that it has one or more fixed arguments, and the rest are gathered into the rightmost argument.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00726))_

```
var __slice = Array.prototype.slice;
function rightVariadic (fn) {
if (fn.length < 1) return fn;
return function () {
var ordinaryArgs = (1 <= arguments.length ?
__slice.call(arguments, 0, fn.length - 1) : []),
restOfTheArgsList = __slice.call(arguments, fn.length - 1),
args = (fn.length <= arguments.length ?
ordinaryArgs.concat([restOfTheArgsList]) : []);
return fn.apply(this, args);
}
};
var firstAndButFirst = rightVariadic(function test (first, butFirst) {
return [first, butFirst]
});
firstAndButFirst('why', 'hello', 'there', 'little', 'droid')
//=> ["why",["hello","there","little","droid"]]
```

### Technical frame 7: Recipes with Basic Functions / Left-Variadic Functions / left-variadic destructuring

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00747))_

> But we can write our own left-gathering function utility using the same principles without all the tedium:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00744))_

```
const [...butLast, last] = ['why', 'hello', 'there', 'little', 'droid'];
//=> Unexpected token
```

### Technical frame 8: Recipes with Basic Functions / Left-Variadic Functions / left-variadic destructuring

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00749))_

> With leftGather , we have to supply the length of the array we wish to use as the result, and it gathers excess arguments into it from the left, just like leftVariadic gathers excess parameters for a function.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00748))_

```
const leftGather = (outputArrayLength) => {
return function (inputArray) {
return [inputArray.slice(0, inputArray.length - outputArrayLength + 1)].conc\
at(
inputArray.slice(inputArray.length - outputArrayLength + 1)
)
}
};
const [butLast, last] = leftGather(2)(['why', 'hello', 'there', 'little', 'droid\
']);
butLast
//=> ['why', 'hello', 'there', 'little']
last
//=> 'droid'
```

### Technical frame 9: Picking the Bean: Choice and Truthiness / function parameters are eager

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00804))_

> If we need to have functions with control-flow semantics, we can pass anonymous functions. We obviously don't need anything like this for or and and , but to demonstrate the technique:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00802))_

```
const or = (a, b) => a || b
const and = (a, b) => a && b
const even = (n) =>
or(n === 0, and(n !== 1, even(n - 2)))
even(42)
//=> Maximum call stack size exceeded.
```

### Technical frame 10: Composing and Decomposing Data / Arrays and Destructuring Arguments / destructuring parameters

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00878))_

> It looks like destructuring. It acts like destructuring. There is only one difference: We have not tried gathering. Let's do that:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00875))_

```
foo()
bar("smaug")
baz(1, 2, 3)
```

### Technical frame 11: Composing and Decomposing Data / Arrays and Destructuring Arguments / destructuring parameters

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00878))_

> It looks like destructuring. It acts like destructuring. There is only one difference: We have not tried gathering. Let's do that:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00877))_

```
const foo = () => ...
const bar = (name) => ...
const baz = (a, b, c) => ...
```

### Technical frame 12: Yes. Consider this variation: / Making Data Out Of Functions / the vireo

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01367))_

> For consistency with the way combinators are written as functions taking just one parameter, we'll curry 78 the function:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01366))_

```
(first, second) => (selector) => selector(first)(second)
```

### Technical frame 13: Yes. Consider this variation: / Making Data Out Of Functions / the vireo

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01374))_

> As an aside, the Vireo is a little like JavaScript's .apply function. It says, 'take these two values and apply them to this function.' There are other, similar combinators that apply values to functions. One notable example is the 'thrush' or T combinator: It takes one value and applies it to a function. It is known to most programmers as .tap .

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01368))_

```
(first) => (second) => (selector) => selector(first)(second)
```
