# Scope

The first function is the result of currying _[a]_ the second function. Calling a curried function with only some of its arguments is sometimes called partial application _[b]_ . Some programming languages automatically curry and partially evaluate functions without the need to manually nest them.

## **shadowy variables from a shadowy planet**

An interesting thing happens when a variable has the same name as an ancestor environment’s variable. Consider:

- (x) => (x, y) => x + y

The function (x, y) => x + y is a pure function, because its x is defined within its own environment. Although its parent also defines an x, it is ignored when evaluating x + y. JavaScript always searches for a binding starting with the functions own environment and then each parent in turn until it finds one. The same is true of: (x) => (x, y) => (w, z) => (w) => x + y + z

When evaluating x + y + z, JavaScript will find x and y in the great-grandparent scope and z in the parent scope. The x in the great-great-grandparent scope is ignored, as are both ws. When a variable has the same name as an ancestor environment’s binding, it is said to _shadow_ the ancestor.

This is often a good thing.

## **which came first, the chicken or the egg?**

This behaviour of pure functions and closures has many, many consequences that can be exploited to write software. We are going to explore them in some detail as well as look at some of the other mechanisms JavaScript provides for working with variables and mutable state.

But before we do so, there’s one final question: Where does the ancestry start? If there’s no other code in a file, what is (x) => x’s parent environment? _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00059))_
