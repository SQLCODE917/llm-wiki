## Statements

- Another basic building block is partial application . When a function takes multiple arguments, we 'apply' the function to the arguments by evaluating it with all of the arguments, producing a value. But what if we only supply some of the arguments? In that case, we can't get the final value, but we can get a function that represents part of our application. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00591))_
- Code is easier than words for this. The Underscore 39 library provides a higher-order function called map . 40 It applies another function to each element of an array, like this: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00592))_
- The resulting functionsquareAll -is still the map function, it's just that we've applied one of its two arguments already. squareAll is nice, but why write one function every time we want to partially apply a function to a map? We can abstract this one level higher. mapWith takes any function as an argument and returns a partially applied map function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00597))_
- We'll discuss mapWith again. The important thing to see is that partial application is orthogonal to composition, and that they both work together nicely: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00599))_
- Wegeneralized composition with the compose combinator. Partial application also has a combinator, which we'll see in the partial recipe. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00603))_
