# Recipe

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about recipe:

## Statements

### Recipes with Basic Functions / Disclaimer

- The recipes are written for practicality, and their implementation may introduce JavaScript features that haven't been discussed in the text to this point, such as methods and/or prototypes. The overall use of each recipe will fit within the spirit of the language discussed so far, even if the implementations may not. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00657))_

### Recipes with Basic Functions / Partial Application

- These two recipes are for quickly and simply applying a single argument, either the leftmost or rightmost. 48 If you want to bind more than one argument, or you want to leave a 'hole' in the argument list, you will need to either use a generalized partial recipe, or you will need to repeatedly apply arguments. They are context-agnostic. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00660))_

### Recipes with Basic Functions / Maybe

- This recipe concerns a pattern that is very common: A function fn takes a value as a parameter, and its behaviour by design is to do nothing if the parameter is nothing: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00696))_

- Naturally, there's a function decorator recipe for that, borrowed from Haskell's maybe monad 50 , Ruby's andand 51 , and CoffeeScript's existential method invocation: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00700))_

### Recipes with Data / Disclaimer

- The recipes are written for practicality, and their implementation may introduce JavaScript features that haven't been discussed in the text to this point, such as methods and/or prototypes. The overall use of each recipe will fit within the spirit of the language discussed so far, even if the implementations may not. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01428))_


## Technical atoms

### Technical frame 1: Recipes with Basic Functions / Partial Application

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00662))_

> As noted above, our partial recipe allows us to create functions that are partial applications of functions that are context aware. We'd need a different recipe if we wish to create partial applications of object methods.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00661))_

```
const callFirst = (fn, larg) =>
function (...rest) {
return fn.call(this, larg, ...rest);
}
const callLast = (fn, rarg) =>
function (...rest) {
return fn.call(this, ...rest, rarg);
}
const greet = (me, you) =>
`Hello, ${you}, my name is ${me}`;
const heliosSaysHello = callFirst(greet, 'Helios');
heliosSaysHello('Eartha')
//=> 'Hello, Eartha, my name is Helios'
const sayHelloToCeline = callLast(greet, 'Celine');
sayHelloToCeline('Eartha')
//=> 'Hello, Celine, my name is Eartha'
```

### Technical frame 2: Recipes with Basic Functions / Maybe

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00698))_

> Alternately, the function may be intended to work with any value, but the code calling the function wishes to emulate the behaviour of doing nothing by design when given nothing:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00697))_

```
const isSomething = (value) =>
value !== null && value !== void 0;
const checksForSomething = (value) => {
if (isSomething(value)) {
// function's true logic
}
}
```

### Technical frame 3: Recipes with Basic Functions / Maybe

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00708))_

> If some code ever tries to call model.setSomething with nothing, the operation will be skipped.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00701))_

```
const maybe = (fn) =>
function (...args) {
if (args.length === 0) {
return
}
else {
for (let arg of args) {
if (arg == null) return;
}
```

### Technical frame 4: Recipes with Basic Functions / Maybe

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00708))_

> If some code ever tries to call model.setSomething with nothing, the operation will be skipped.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00703))_

```
return fn.apply(this, args)
}
}
```

matthew knox
A different kind of language requires a different kind of book.
JavaScript holds surprising depths-its scoping rules are neither strictly lexical nor strictly dynamic, and it supports procedural, object-oriented (in several flavors!), and functional programming. Many books try to hide most of those capabilities away, giving you recipes for writing JavaScript in a way that approximates class-centric programming in other languages. Not JavaScript Allongé. It starts with the fundamentals of values, functions, and objects, and then guides you through JavaScript from the inside with exploratory bits of code that illustrate scoping, combinators, context, state, prototypes, and constructors.

Partial Application
In Building Blocks, we discussed partial application, but we didn't write a generalized recipe for it. This is such a common tool that many libraries provide some form of partial application. You'll find examples in Lemonad 45 from Michael Fogus, Functional JavaScript 46 from Oliver Steele and the terse but handy node-ap 47 from James Halliday.

> What we have now is a function that takes a function and 'flips' the order of arguments around, then curries it. So let's call it flipAndCurry :
