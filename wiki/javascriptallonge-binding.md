# Binding

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about binding:

## Statements

### That Constant Coffee Craving

- 34

The first sip: Basic Functions ((diameter_fn) => { **const** PI = 3; **return** diameter_fn(2) })( (() => { **const** PI = 3.14159265; **return** (diameter) => diameter * PI })() ) _//=> 6.2831853_

Yes. Binding values to names with const works just like binding values to names with parameter invocations, it uses lexical scope.

## **are consts also from a shadowy planet?**

We just saw that values bound with const use lexical scope, just like values bound with parameters. They are looked up in the environment where they are declared. And we know that functions create environments. Parameters are declared when we create functions, so it makes sense that parameters are bound to environments created when we invoke functions.

But const statements can appear inside blocks, and we saw that blocks can appear inside of other blocks, including function bodies. So where are const variables bound? In the function environment? Or in an environment corresponding to the block?

We can test this by creating another conflict. But instead of binding two different variables to the same name in two different places, we’ll bind two different values to the same name, but one environment will be completely enclosed by the other.

Let’s start, as above, by doing this with parameters. We’ll start with:

((PI) => (diameter) => diameter * PI )(3.14159265) And gratuitously wrap it in another IIFE so that we can bind PI to something else: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00070))_

### Reassignment

- Composing and Decomposing Data

127 {age: 49, '..': global-environment} However, if we don’t shadow age with let, reassigning within the block changes the original: (() => { **let** age = 49; **if** ( **true** ) { age = 50; } **return** age; })() _//=> 50_

Like evaluating variable labels, when a binding is rebound, JavaScript searches for the binding in the current environment and then each ancestor in turn until it finds one. It then rebinds the name in that environment.

## **mixing let and const**

Some programmers dislike deliberately shadowing variables. The suggestion is that shadowing a variable is confusing code. If you buy that argument, the way that shadowing works in JavaScript exists to protect us from accidentally shadowing a variable when we move code around.

If you dislike deliberately shadowing variables, you’ll probably take an even more opprobrious view of mixing const and let semantics with a shadowed variable: (() => { **let** age = 49; **if** ( **true** ) { **const** age = 50; } age = 51; **return** age; })() _//=> 51_

Shadowing a let with a const does not change our ability to rebind the variable in its original scope. And: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00179))_
