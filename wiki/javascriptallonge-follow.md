# Follow

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about follow:

## Statements

### Or even: / back on the block

- 21 You can also separate statements with line breaks. Readers who follow internet flame-fests may be aware of something called automatic semicolon insertion. Basically, there's a step where JavaScript looks at your code and follows some rules to guess where you meant to put semicolons in should you leave them out. This feature was originally created as a kind of helpful error-correction. Some programmers argue that since it's part of the language's definition, it's fair game to write code that exploits it, so they deliberately omit any semicolon that JavaScript will insert for them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00246))_

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Mutation / mutation and data structures

- One pattern many people follow is to be liberal with mutation when constructing data, but conservative with mutation when consuming data. Let's recall linked lists from Plain Old JavaScript Objects. While we're executing the mapWith function, we're constructing a new linked list. By this pattern, we would be happy to use mutation to construct the list while running mapWith . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01143))_

### Yes. Consider this variation: / Copy on Write / copy-on-write

- Looking at the code again, you see that the copy function doesn't copy on write: It follows the pattern that while constructing something, we own it and can be liberal with mutation. Once we're done with it and give it to someone else, we need to be conservative and use a strategy like copy-on-read or copy-on-write. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01255))_

### Yes. Consider this variation: / Making Data Out Of Functions / say 'please'

- Wekeep using the same pattern in our functions: aPair === EMPTY ? doSomething : doSomethingElse . This follows the philosophy we used with data structures: The function doing the work inspects the data structure. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01389))_
