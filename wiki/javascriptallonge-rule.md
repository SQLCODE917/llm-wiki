# Rule

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about rule:

## Statements

### floating

- But as a rule, if you need to work with real numbers, you should have more than a nodding acquaintance with the IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic 15 . Professional programmers almost never use floating point numbers to represent monetary amounts. For example, '$43.21' will nearly always be presented as two numbers: 43 for dollars and 21 for cents, not 43.21 . In this book, we need not think about such details, but outside of this book, we must. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-31a4cf47-00159))_

### void

- 21 You can also separate statements with line breaks. Readers who follow internet flame-fests may be aware of something called automatic semicolon insertion. Basically, there's a step where JavaScript looks at your code and follows some rules to guess where you meant to put semicolons in should you leave them out. This feature was originally created as a kind of helpful error-correction. Some programmers argue that since it's part of the language's definition, it's fair game to write code that exploits it, so they deliberately omit any semicolon that JavaScript will insert for them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-31a4cf47-00249))_

### are consts also from a shadowy planet?

- Again, confusing. Typically, we want to bind our names as close to where we need them as possible. This design rule is called the Principle of Least Privilege 32 , and it has both quality and security implications. Being able to bind a name inside of a block means that if the name is only needed in the block, we are not 'leaking' its binding to other parts of the code that do not need to interact with it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-31a4cf47-00492))_

### Self-Similarity

- Let's convert our rules to array literals. The first rule is simple: [] is a list. How about the second rule? We can express that using a spread. Given an element e and a list list , [e, ...list] is a list. We can test this manually by building up a list: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-31a4cf47-00890))_


## Technical atoms

### Technical frame 1: void

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-31a4cf47-00249))_

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-31a4cf47-00250))_

```
(() => 2 + 2)() //=> 4 (() => { 2 + 2 })() //=> undefined (() => (1 + 1, 2 + 2))() //=> 4 (() => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 })() //=> undefined
```

> So how do we get a function that evaluates a block to return a value when applied?

### Technical frame 3: Self-Similarity

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-31a4cf47-00892))_

> Thanks to the parallel between array literals + spreads with destructuring + rests, we can also use the same rules to decompose lists:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-31a4cf47-00891))_

```
[] //=> [] ["baz", ...[]] //=> ["baz"] ["bar", ...["baz"]] //=> ["bar","baz"] ["foo", ...["bar", "baz"]] //=> ["foo","bar","baz"]
```

### Technical frame 4: Self-Similarity

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-31a4cf47-00897))_

> Armed with our definition of an empty list and with what we've already learned, we can build a great many functions that operate on arrays. We know that we can get the length of an array using its .length . But as an exercise, how would we write a length function using just what we have already?

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-31a4cf47-00895))_

```
const [first, ...rest] = []; first //=> undefined rest //=> []: const [first, ...rest] = ["foo"]; first //=> "foo" rest //=> [] const [first, ...rest] = ["foo", "bar"]; first //=> "foo" rest //=> ["bar"] const [first, ...rest] = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]; first //=> "foo" rest //=> ["bar","baz"] For the purpose of this exploration, we will presume the following: const isEmpty = ([first, ...rest]) => first === undefined ;
```
