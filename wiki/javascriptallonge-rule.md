0.1 _//=> 0.1_ 0.1 + 0.1 _//=> 0.2_ 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 _//=> 0.30000000000000004_

This kind of “inexactitude” can be ignored when performing calculations that have an acceptable deviation. For example, when centering some text on a page, as long as the difference between what you might calculate longhand and JavaScript’s calculation is less than a pixel, there is no observable error.

But as a rule, if you need to work with real numbers, you should have more than a nodding acquaintance with the IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic[15] . Professional programmers almost never use floating point numbers to represent monetary amounts. For example, “$43.21” will nearly always be presented as two numbers: 43 for dollars and 21 for cents, not 43.21. In this book, we need not think about such details, but outside of this book, we must.

## **operations on numbers**

As we’ve seen, JavaScript has many common arithmetic operators. We can create expressions that look very much like mathematical expressions, for example we can write 1 + 1 or 2 * 3 or 42 - 34 or even 6 / 2. These can be combined to make more complex expressions, like 2 * 5 + 1.

In JavaScript, operators have an order of precedence designed to mimic the way humans typically parse written arithmetic. So:

2 * 5 + 1 _//=> 11_ 1 + 5 * 2 _//=> 11_

JavaScript treats the expressions as if we had written (2 * 5) + 1 and 1 + (5 * 2), because the * operator has a _higher precedence_ than the + operator. JavaScript has many more operators. In a sense, they behave like little functions. If we write 1 + 2, this is conceptually similar to writing plus(1, 2) (assuming we have a function that adds two numbers bound to the name plus, of course).

In addition to the common +, -, *, and /, JavaScript also supports modulus, %, and unary negation, -:

### As Little As Possible About Functions, But No Less

## **As Little As Possible About Functions, But No Less**

In JavaScript, functions are values, but they are also much more than simple numbers, strings, or even complex data structures like trees or maps. Functions represent computations to be performed. Like numbers, strings, and arrays, they have a representation. Let’s start with the second simplest possible function.[16] In JavaScript, it looks like this:

## () => 0

This is a function that is applied to no values and returns 0. Let’s verify that our function is a value like all others:

- (() => 0) _//=> [Function]_ What!? Why didn’t it type back () => 0 for us? This _seems_ to break our rule that if an expression is also a value, JavaScript will give the same value back to us. What’s going on? The simplest and easiest answer is that although the JavaScript interpreter does indeed return that value, displaying it on the screen is a slightly different matter. [Function] is a choice made by the people who wrote Node.js, the JavaScript environment that hosts the JavaScript REPL. If you try the same thing in a browser, you may see something else.

The first sip: Basic Functions

## (() => {})()

_//=> undefined_

We said that the function returns the result of evaluating a _block_ , and we said that a block is a (possibly empty) list of JavaScript _statements_ separated by semicolons.[21] Something like: { statement[1] ; statement[2] ; statement[3] ; ... ; statement[n] } We haven’t discussed these _statements_ . What’s a statement?

There are many kinds of JavaScript statements, but the first kind is one we’ve already met. An expression is a JavaScript statement. Although they aren’t very practical, these are valid JavaScript functions, and they return undefined when applied: () => { 2 + 2 } () => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 } As we saw with commas above, we can rearrange these functions onto multiple lines when we feel its more readable that way: () => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 } But no matter how we arrange them, a block with one or more expressions still evaluates to undefined: (() => { 2 + 2 })() _//=> undefined_ (() => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 })() _//=> undefined_ (() => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 })() _//=> undefined_ As you can see, a block with one expression does not behave like an expression, and a block with more than one expression does not behave like an expression constructed with the comma operator:

> 21You can also separate statements with line breaks. Readers who follow internet flame-fests may be aware of something called automatic semicolon insertion. Basically, there’s a step where JavaScript looks at your code and follows some rules to guess where you meant to put semicolons in should you leave them out. This feature was originally created as a kind of helpful error-correction. Some programmers argue that since it’s part of the language’s definition, it’s fair game to write code that exploits it, so they deliberately omit any semicolon that JavaScript will insert for them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00050))_

### That Constant Coffee Craving

37 })(2) _//=> 6.2831853_

Ah! const statements don’t just shadow values bound within the environments created by functions, they shadow values bound within environments created by blocks!

This is enormously important. Consider the alternative: What if const could be declared inside of a block, but it always bound the name in the function’s scope. In that case, we’d see things like this: ((diameter) => { **const** PI = 3.14159265; **if** ( **true** ) { **const** PI = 3; } **return** diameter * PI; })(2) _//=> would return 6 if const had function scope_

If const always bound its value to the name defined in the function’s environment, placing a const statement inside of a block would merely rebind the existing name, overwriting its old contents. That would be super-confusing. And this code would “work:” ((diameter) => { **if** ( **true** ) { **const** PI = 3.14159265; } **return** diameter * PI; })(2) _//=> would return 6.2831853 if const had function scope_ Again, confusing. Typically, we want to bind our names as close to where we need them as possible. This design rule is called the Principle of Least Privilege[32] , and it has both quality and security implications. Being able to bind a name inside of a block means that if the name is only needed in the block, we are not “leaking” its binding to other parts of the code that do not need to interact with it.

## **rebinding**

By default, JavaScript permits us to _rebind_ new values to names bound with a parameter. For example, we can write:
