# Feature

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about feature:

## Statements

### A Pull of the Lever: Prefaces / About JavaScript Allongé / why the 'six' edition?

- ECMAScript 2015 (formerly called ECMAScript 6 or 'ES6'), is ushering in a very large number of improvements to the way programmers can write small, powerful components and combine them into larger, fully featured programs. Features like destructuring, block-structured variables, iterables, generators, and the class keyword are poised to make JavaScript programming more expressive. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00021))_

- Working around the missing features was a necessary evil. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00033))_

- And presto, rest collects the rest of the arguments without a lot of malarky involving slicing arguments . Not having to work around these kinds of missing features makes JavaScript Allongé a better book , because it can focus on the why to do something and when to do it, instead of on the how to make it work _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00038))_

### A Pull of the Lever: Prefaces / Foreword to the 'Six' edition

- A larger upgrade would substantially improve JavaScript, but without being as radical as ECMAScript 4. This upgrade became ECMAScript 6 (some features that were initially discussed will show up later, in upcoming ECMAScript versions). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00071))_

### Or even: / back on the block

- 21 You can also separate statements with line breaks. Readers who follow internet flame-fests may be aware of something called automatic semicolon insertion. Basically, there's a step where JavaScript looks at your code and follows some rules to guess where you meant to put semicolons in should you leave them out. This feature was originally created as a kind of helpful error-correction. Some programmers argue that since it's part of the language's definition, it's fair game to write code that exploits it, so they deliberately omit any semicolon that JavaScript will insert for them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00246))_
