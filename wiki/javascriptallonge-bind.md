## **That Constant Coffee Craving**

Up to now, all we’ve really seen are _anonymous functions_ , functions that don’t have a name. This feels very different from programming in most other languages, where the focus is on naming functions, methods, and procedures. Naming things is a critical part of programming, but all we’ve seen so far is how to name arguments.

There are other ways to name things in JavaScript, but before we learn some of those, let’s see how to use what we already have to name things. Let’s revisit a very simple example: (diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265

What is this “3.14159265” number? PI[28] , obviously. We’d like to name it so that we can write something like: (diameter) => diameter * PI

In order to bind 3.14159265 to the name PI, we’ll need a function with a parameter of PI applied to an argument of 3.14159265. If we put our function expression in parentheses, we can apply it to the argument of 3.14159265:

((PI) => _// ????_ )(3.14159265) What do we put inside our new function that binds 3.14159265 to the name PI when evaluated? Our circumference function, of course:

((PI) => (diameter) => diameter * PI )(3.14159265) This expression, when evaluated, returns a function that calculates circumferences. That sounds bad, but when we think about it, (diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265 is also an expression, that when evaluated, returns a function that calculates circumferences. All of our “functions” are expressions. This one has a few more moving parts, that’s all. But we can use it just like (diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265.

Let’s test it:

The first sip: Basic Functions ((diameter_fn) => { **const** PI = 3; **return** diameter_fn(2) })( (() => { **const** PI = 3.14159265; **return** (diameter) => diameter * PI })() ) _//=> 6.2831853_

Yes. Binding values to names with const works just like binding values to names with parameter invocations, it uses lexical scope.

## **are consts also from a shadowy planet?**

We just saw that values bound with const use lexical scope, just like values bound with parameters. They are looked up in the environment where they are declared. And we know that functions create environments. Parameters are declared when we create functions, so it makes sense that parameters are bound to environments created when we invoke functions.

But const statements can appear inside blocks, and we saw that blocks can appear inside of other blocks, including function bodies. So where are const variables bound? In the function environment? Or in an environment corresponding to the block?

We can test this by creating another conflict. But instead of binding two different variables to the same name in two different places, we’ll bind two different values to the same name, but one environment will be completely enclosed by the other.

Let’s start, as above, by doing this with parameters. We’ll start with:

((PI) => (diameter) => diameter * PI )(3.14159265) And gratuitously wrap it in another IIFE so that we can bind PI to something else: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00070))_

Ah! const statements don’t just shadow values bound within the environments created by functions, they shadow values bound within environments created by blocks!

This is enormously important. Consider the alternative: What if const could be declared inside of a block, but it always bound the name in the function’s scope. In that case, we’d see things like this: ((diameter) => { **const** PI = 3.14159265; **if** ( **true** ) { **const** PI = 3; } **return** diameter * PI; })(2) _//=> would return 6 if const had function scope_

If const always bound its value to the name defined in the function’s environment, placing a const statement inside of a block would merely rebind the existing name, overwriting its old contents. That would be super-confusing. And this code would “work:” ((diameter) => { **if** ( **true** ) { **const** PI = 3.14159265; } **return** diameter * PI; })(2) _//=> would return 6.2831853 if const had function scope_ Again, confusing. Typically, we want to bind our names as close to where we need them as possible. This design rule is called the Principle of Least Privilege[32] , and it has both quality and security implications. Being able to bind a name inside of a block means that if the name is only needed in the block, we are not “leaking” its binding to other parts of the code that do not need to interact with it.

## **rebinding**

By default, JavaScript permits us to _rebind_ new values to names bound with a parameter. For example, we can write:

### Arrays and Destructuring Arguments

- Composing and Decomposing Data

83 **const** [what] = []; That match would fail because the array doesn’t have an element to assign to what. But this is not how JavaScript works. JavaScript tries its best to assign things, and if there isn’t something that fits, JavaScript binds undefined to the name. Therefore: **const** [what] = []; what _//=> undefined_ **const** [which, what, who] = ["duck feet", "tiger tail"]; who _//=> undefined_ And if there aren’t any items to assign with ..., JavaScript assigns an empty array: **const** [...they] = []; they _//=> []_ **const** [which, what, ...they] = ["duck feet", "tiger tail"]; they _//=> []_ From its very inception, JavaScript has striven to avoid catastrophic errors. As a result, it often coerces values, passes undefined around, or does whatever it can to keep executing without failing. This often means that we must write our own code to detect failure conditions, as we cannot reply on the language to point out when we are doing semantically meaningless things.

## **destructuring and return values**

Some languages support multiple return values: A function can return several things at once, like a value and an error code. This can easily be emulated in JavaScript with destructuring: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00129))_

### Reassignment

- Composing and Decomposing Data

126

JavaScript does not permit us to rebind a name that has been bound with const. We can _shadow_ it by using const to declare a new binding with a new function or block scope, but we cannot rebind a name that was bound with const in an existing scope.

Rebinding parameters is usually avoided, but what about rebinding names we declare within a function? What we want is a statement that works like const, but permits us to rebind variables. JavaScript has such a thing, it’s called let: **let** age = 52; age = 53; age _//=> 53_

We took the time to carefully examine what happens with bindings in environments. Let’s take the time to explore what happens with reassigning values to variables. The key is to understand that we are rebinding a different value to the same name in the same environment.

So let’s consider what happens with a shadowed variable: (() => { **let** age = 49; **if** ( **true** ) { **let** age = 50; } **return** age; })() _//=> 49_

Using let to bind 50 to age within the block does not change the binding of age in the outer environment because the binding of age in the block shadows the binding of age in the outer environment, just like const. We go from: {age: 49, '..': global-environment} To: {age: 50, '..': {age: 49, '..': global-environment}} Then back to: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00178))_

- Composing and Decomposing Data

127 {age: 49, '..': global-environment} However, if we don’t shadow age with let, reassigning within the block changes the original: (() => { **let** age = 49; **if** ( **true** ) { age = 50; } **return** age; })() _//=> 50_

Like evaluating variable labels, when a binding is rebound, JavaScript searches for the binding in the current environment and then each ancestor in turn until it finds one. It then rebinds the name in that environment.

## **mixing let and const**

Some programmers dislike deliberately shadowing variables. The suggestion is that shadowing a variable is confusing code. If you buy that argument, the way that shadowing works in JavaScript exists to protect us from accidentally shadowing a variable when we move code around.

If you dislike deliberately shadowing variables, you’ll probably take an even more opprobrious view of mixing const and let semantics with a shadowed variable: (() => { **let** age = 49; **if** ( **true** ) { **const** age = 50; } age = 51; **return** age; })() _//=> 51_

Shadowing a let with a const does not change our ability to rebind the variable in its original scope. And: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00179))_
