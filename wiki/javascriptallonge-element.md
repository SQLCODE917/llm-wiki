# Element

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about element:

## Statements

- The big elements of divide and conquer are a method for decomposing a problem into smaller problems, a test for the smallest possible problem, and a means of putting the pieces back together. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00915))_
- There’s no making copies of arrays, the time to cdr a list with five elements is the same as the time to cdr a list with 5,000 elements, and no temporary arrays are needed. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01050))_
- For example, if we spread a large collection just to find an element in the collection, it might have been wiser to iterate over the element using its iterator directly. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01573))_
- first returns the first element of an iterable (if it has one), and rest returns an iterable that iterates over all but the first element of an iterable. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01612))_
- Every subsequent element of the fibonacci sequence is the sum of the previous two elements. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01658))_
- We take advantage of the for...of loop in a plain and direct way: For each element e, if it is iterable, treat it as a tree and iterate over it, yielding each of its elements. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01750))_
- Finally, we take the first element of that filtered, squared iterable and now JavaScript actually iterates over the stack’s elements, and it only needs to square two of those elements, 29 and 28, to return the answer. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01797))_
- Array elements can be extracted using [ and ] as postfix operators. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00841))_
- Given an element e and a list list, [e, ...list] is a list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00890))_
- Lather, rinse, repeat: Ever time we call mapWith, we’re creating a new array, copying all the elements from prepend into the new array, and then we no longer use prepend. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01023))_
- In JavaScript, it’s still much, much, much faster to get all the elements except the head from a linked list than from an array. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01050))_
- Arrays avoid this problem by pessimistically copying all the references whenever we extract an element or sequence of elements from them (We’ll see this explained later in Mutation). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01062))_
- If we _know_ that a list doesn’t share any elements with another list, we can safely modify it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01225))_
- And worst of all, we’re getting really low-level with details like knowing that the elements of an array are indexed with consecutive integers that begin with 0. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01283))_
- Acting on the elements of a collection one at a time is called _iterating over the contents_ , and JavaScript has a standard way to iterate over the contents of collections. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01530))_
- Instead of having a function that you call to get the next element, you have an object with a .next() method. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01550))_
- elements that are not, themselves, iterable. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01644))_
- The first element of the fibonacci sequence is zero. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01656))_
- The second element of the fibonacci sequence is one. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01657))_

## Technical atoms

### Technical atom 1

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00916))_

> This simpler form of “divide and conquer” is called _linear recursion_ . It’s very useful and simple to understand. Let’s take another example. Sometimes we want to _flatten_ an array, that is, an array of arrays needs to be turned into one array of elements that aren’t arrays.[62] We already know how to divide arrays into smaller pieces. How do we decide whether a smaller problem is solvable? We need a test for the terminal case. Happily, there is something along these lines provided for us:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00917))_

> Array.isArray("foo") - _//=> false_

### Technical atom 2

> Array.isArray(["foo"]) - _//=> true_

### Technical atom 3

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00926))_

> If we want to square each number in a list, we could write: **const** squareAll = ([first, ...rest]) => first === **undefined** ? [] : [first * first, ...squareAll(rest)\ ]; squareAll([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) _//=> [1,4,9,16,25]_ And if we wanted to “truthify” each element in a list, we could write:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00928))_

> 91 **const** truthyAll = ([first, ...rest]) => first === **undefined**

### Technical atom 4

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00929))_

> ? [] : [!!first, ...truthyAll(rest)]; truthyAll([ **null** , **true** , 25, **false** , "foo"]) _//=> [false,true,true,false,true]_ This specific case of linear recursion is called “mapping,” and it is not necessary to constantly write out the same pattern again and again. Functions can take functions as arguments, so let’s “extract” the thing to do to each element and separate it from the business of taking an array apart, doing the thing, and putting the array back together.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00930))_

> Given the signature: **const** mapWith = (fn, array) => _// ..._

### Technical atom 5

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01060))_

> Well, linked lists are fast for a few things, like taking the front element off a list, and taking the remainder of a list. But not for iterating over a list: Pointer chasing through memory is quite a bit slower than incrementing an index. In addition to the extra fetches to dereference pointers, pointer chasing suffers from cache misses. And if you want an arbitrary item from a list, you have to iterate through the list element by element, whereas with the indexed array you just fetch it.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01061))_

> We have avoided discussing rebinding and mutating values, but if we want to change elements of our lists, the naïve linked list implementation suffers as well: When we take the cdr of a linked list, we are sharing the elements.

### Technical atom 6

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01220))_

> When you take the rest of a linked list with its reference, you are given the exact same nodes of the elements of the original list.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01221))_

> The consequence of this is that if you have an array, and you take it’s “rest,” your “child” array is a copy of the elements of the parent array.

### Technical atom 7

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01620))_

> Stack3.from = **function** (iterable) { **const** stack = **this** (); **for** ( **let** element **of** iterable) { stack.push(element); } **return** stack; } Pair1.from = (iterable) => ( **function** iterationToList (iteration) { **const** {done, value} = iteration.next(); **return** done ? EMPTY : Pair1(value, iterationToList(iteration)); })(iterable[Symbol.iterator]()) Now we can go “end to end,” If we want to map a linked list of numbers to a linked list of the squares of some numbers, we ca

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01621))_

> Pair1.from(Squares) _//=> {"first":0,_ "rest":{"first":1, "rest":{"first":4, "rest":{ ... Served by the Pot: Collections 200

### Technical atom 8

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01790))_

> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] .map((x) => x * x) .filter((x) => x % 2 == 0) .reduce((seed, element) => seed + element, 0) Pair.from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) .map((x) => x * x) .filter((x) => x % 2 == 0) .reduce((seed, element) => seed + element, 0) Both expressions evaluate to 220. And the array is faster in practice, because it is a built-in data type that performs its work in the engine, while the linked list does its work in JavaScript.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01792))_

> When working with very large collections and many operations, this can be important.

### Technical atom 9

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-01790))_

> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] .map((x) => x * x) .filter((x) => x % 2 == 0) .reduce((seed, element) => seed + element, 0) Pair.from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) .map((x) => x * x) .filter((x) => x % 2 == 0) .reduce((seed, element) => seed + element, 0) Both expressions evaluate to 220. And the array is faster in practice, because it is a built-in data type that performs its work in the engine, while the linked list does its work in JavaScript.
