## Statements

- Lists are not the only way to represent collections of things, but they are the 'oldest' data structure in the history of high level languages, because they map very closely to the way the hardware is organized in a computer. Lists are obviously very handy for homogeneous collections of things, like a shopping list: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01062))_
- Remembering that the name is the first item is error-prone, and being expected to look at user[0][1] and know that we are talking about a surname is unreasonable. So back when lists were the only things available, programmers would introduce constants to make things easier on themselves: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01065))_
- Now they could write user[NAME][LAST] or user[OCCUPATION][TITLE] instead of user[0][1] or user[1][0] . Over time, this need to build heterogeneous data structures with access to members by name evolved into the Dictionary 69 data type, a mapping from a unique set of objects to another set of objects. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01067))_
- Dictionaries store key-value pairs, so instead of binding NAME to 0 and then storing a name in an array at index 0 , we can bind a name directly to name in a dictionary, and we let JavaScript sort out whether the implementation is a list of key-value pairs, a hashed collection, a tree of some sort, or anything else. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01068))_
- JavaScript has dictionaries, and it calls them 'objects.' The word 'object' is loaded in programming circles, due to the widespread use of the term 'object-oriented programming' that was coined by Alan Kay but has since come to mean many, many things to many different people. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01069))_
- In JavaScript, an object is a map from string keys to values. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01070))_

## Statements by subsection

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Plain Old JavaScript Objects / literal object syntax

- JavaScript has a literal syntax for creating objects. This object maps values to the keys year , month , and day : _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01073))_
- Values contained within an object work just like values contained within an array, we access them by reference to the original: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01077))_
- Names needn't be alphanumeric strings. For anything else, enclose the label in quotes: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01079))_
- If the name is an alphanumeric string conforming to the same rules as names of variables, there's a simplified syntax for accessing the values: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01081))_
- Expressions can be used for keys as well. The syntax is to enclose the key's expression in [ and ] : _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01083))_
- It is very common to associate named function expressions with keys in objects, and there is a 'compact method syntax' for binding named function expressions to keywords: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01091))_
- Values contained within an object work just like values contained within an array, we access them by reference to the original: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01077))_

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Plain Old JavaScript Objects / destructuring objects

- Terrible grammar and capitalization, but let's move on. It is very common to write things like title: title when destructuring objects. When the label is a valid variable name, it's often the most obvious variable name as well. So JavaScript supports a further syntactic optimization: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01100))_

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Plain Old JavaScript Objects / revisiting linked lists

- In essence, this simple implementation used functions to create an abstraction with named elements. But now that we've looked at objects, we can use an object instead of a two-element array. While we're at it, let's use contemporary names. So our linked list nodes will be formed from { first, rest } _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01106))_
- What about mapping? Well, let's start with the simplest possible thing, making a copy of a list. As we saw above, and discussed in Garbage, Garbage Everywhere, it is fast to iterate forward through a linked list. What isn't fast is naïvely copying a list: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01109))_
- The problem here is that linked lists are constructed back-to-front, but we iterate over them frontto-back. So to copy a list, we have to save all the bits on the call stack and then construct the list from back-to-front as all the recursive calls return. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01111))_
- We could follow the strategy of delaying the work. Let's write that naively: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01112))_
- Well, well, well. We have unwittingly reversed the list. This makes sense, if lists are constructed from back to front, and we make a linked list out of items as we iterate through it, we're going to get a backwards copy of the list. This isn't a bad thing by any stretch of the imagination. Let's call it what it is: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01114))_
- Our mapWith function takes twice as long as a straight iteration, because it iterates over the entire list twice, once to map, and once to reverse the list. Likewise, it takes twice as much memory, because it constructs a reverse of the desired result before throwing it away. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01116))_
- Mind you, this is still much, much faster than making partial copies of arrays. For a list of length n , wecreated n superfluous nodes and copied n superfluous values. Whereas our naïve array algorithm created 2 n superfluous arrays and copied n 2 superfluous values. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01117))_
