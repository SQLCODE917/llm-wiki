## Statements

- A common problem in programming is checking for null or undefined (hereafter called 'nothing,' while all other values including 0 , [] and false will be called 'something'). Languages like JavaScript do not strongly enforce the notion that a particular variable or particular property be something, so programs are often written to account for values that may be nothing. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00695))_
- This recipe concerns a pattern that is very common: A function fn takes a value as a parameter, and its behaviour by design is to do nothing if the parameter is nothing: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00696))_
- Alternately, the function may be intended to work with any value, but the code calling the function wishes to emulate the behaviour of doing nothing by design when given nothing: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00698))_
- Naturally, there's a function decorator recipe for that, borrowed from Haskell's maybe monad 50 , Ruby's andand 51 , and CoffeeScript's existential method invocation: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00700))_
- If some code ever tries to call model.setSomething with nothing, the operation will be skipped. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00708))_
