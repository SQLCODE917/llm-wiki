### What JavaScript Allongé is. And isn't.

## **What JavaScript Allongé is. And isn’t.**

**JavaScript Allongé is a book about thinking about programs**

JavaScript Allongé is a book about programming with functions. From functions flow many ideas, from decorators to methods to delegation to mixins, and onwards in so many fruitful directions.

The focus in this book on the underlying ideas, what we might call the fundamentals, and how they combine to form new ideas. The intention is to improve the way we think about programs. That’s a good thing.

But while JavaScript Allongé attempts to be provocative, it is not _prescriptive_ . There is absolutely no suggestion that any of the techniques shown here are the only way to do something, the best way, or even an acceptable way to write programs that are intended to be used, read, and maintained by others.

Software development is a complex field. Choices in development are often driven by social considerations. People often say that software should be written for people to read. Doesn’t that depend upon the people in question? Should code written by a small team of specialists use the same techniques and patterns as code maintained by a continuously changing cast of inexperienced interns?

Choices in software development are also often driven by requirements specific to the type of software being developed. For example, business software written in-house has a very different set of requirements than a library written to be publicly distributed as open-source. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00016))_

A Pull of the Lever: Prefaces

## **Forewords to the First Edition**

## **michael fogus**

As a life-long bibliophile and long-time follower of Reg’s online work, I was excited when he started writing books. However, I’m very conservative about books – let’s just say that if there was an aftershave scented to the essence of “Used Book Store” then I would be first in line to buy. So as you might imagine I was “skeptical” about the decision to release JavaScript Allongé as an ongoing ebook, with a pay-what-you-want model. However, Reg sent me a copy of his book and I was humbled. Not only was this a great book, but it was also a great way to write and distribute books. Having written books myself, I know the pain of soliciting and receiving feedback.

The act of writing is an iterative process with (very often) tight revision loops. However, the process of soliciting feedback, gathering responses, sending out copies, waiting for people to actually read it (if they ever do), receiving feedback and then ultimately making sense out of how to use it takes weeks and sometimes months. On more than one occasion I’ve found myself attempting to reify feedback with content that either no longer existed or was changed beyond recognition. However, with the Leanpub model the read-feedback-change process is extremely efficient, leaving in its wake a quality book that continues to get better as others likewise read and comment into infinitude.

In the case of JavaScript Allongé, you’ll find the Leanpub model a shining example of effectiveness. Reg has crafted (and continues to craft) not only an interesting book from the perspective of a connoisseur, but also an entertaining exploration into some of the most interesting aspects of his art. No matter how much of an expert you think you are, JavaScript Allongé has something to teach you… about coffee. I kid.

As a staunch advocate of functional programming, much of what Reg has written rings true to me. While not exclusively a book about functional programming, JavaScript Allongé will provide a solid foundation for functional techniques. However, you’ll not be beaten about the head and neck with dogma. Instead, every section is motivated by relevant dialog and fortified with compelling source examples. As an author of programming books I admire what Reg has managed to accomplish and I envy the fine reader who finds JavaScript Allongé via some darkened channel in the Internet sprawl and reads it for the first time.

Enjoy.

A different kind of language requires a different kind of book.

JavaScript holds surprising depths–its scoping rules are neither strictly lexical nor strictly dynamic, and it supports procedural, object-oriented (in several flavors!), and functional programming. Many

### Closures and Scope

- The first sip: Basic Functions

23

## **it’s always the environment**

To understand how closures are evaluated, we need to revisit environments. As we’ve said before, all functions are associated with an environment. We also hand-waved something when describing our environment. Remember that we said the environment for ((x) => (y) => x)(1) is {x: 1, ...} and that the environment for ((y) => x)(2) is {y: 2, ...}? Let’s fill in the blanks!

The environment for ((y) => x)(2) is _actually_ {y: 2, '..': {x: 1, ...}}. '..' means something like “parent” or “enclosure” or “super-environment.” It’s (x) => ...’s environment, because the function (y) => x is within (x) => ...’s body. So whenever a function is applied to arguments, its environment always has a reference to its parent environment.

And now you can guess how we evaluate ((y) => x)(2) in the environment {y: 2, '..': {x: 1, ...}}. The variable x isn’t in (y) => ...’s immediate environment, but it is in its parent’s environment, so it evaluates to 1 and that’s what ((y) => x)(2) returns even though it ended up ignoring its own argument.

(x) => x is called the I Combinator, or the _Identity Function_ . (x) => (y) => x is called the K Combinator, or _Kestrel_ . Some people get so excited by this that they write entire books about them, some are great _[a]_ , some–how shall I put this–are interesting _[b]_ if you use Ruby.

> _b_ https://leanpub.com/combinators

Functions can have grandparents too: (x) => (y) => (z) => x + y + z

This function does much the same thing as: (x, y, z) => x + y + z

Only you call it with (1)(2)(3) instead of (1, 2, 3). The other big difference is that you can call it with (1) and get a function back that you can later call with (2)(3). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00058))_

### Mutation

- Composing and Decomposing Data

120 **const** allHallowsEve = [2012, 10, 31]; ( **function** (halloween) { halloween = [2013, 10, 31]; })(allHallowsEve); allHallowsEve _//=> [2012, 10, 31]_ The outer value of allHallowsEve was not changed because all we did was rebind the name halloween within the inner environment. However, what happens if we _mutate_ the value in the inner environment?

**const** allHallowsEve = [2012, 10, 31]; ( **function** (halloween) { halloween[0] = 2013; })(allHallowsEve); allHallowsEve _//=> [2013, 10, 31]_ This is different. We haven’t rebound the inner name to a different variable, we’ve mutated the value that both bindings share. Now that we’ve finished with mutation and aliases, let’s have a look at it.

**==> picture [29 x 29] intentionally omitted <==**

JavaScript permits the reassignment of new values to existing bindings, as well as the reassignment and assignment of new values to elements of containers such as arrays and objects. Mutating existing objects has special implications when two bindings are aliases of the same value.

**==> picture [29 x 29] intentionally omitted <==**

Note well: Declaring a variable const does not prevent us from mutating its value, only from rebinding its name. This is an important distinction.

## **mutation and data structures**

Mutation is a surprisingly complex subject. It is possible to compute anything without ever mutating an existing entity. Languages like Haskell[70] don’t permit mutation at all. In general, mutation makes some algorithms shorter to write and possibly faster, but harder to reason about.

One pattern many people follow is to be liberal with mutation when constructing data, but conservative with mutation when consuming data. Let’s recall linked lists from Plain Old JavaScript Objects. While we’re executing the mapWith function, we’re constructing a new linked list. By this pattern, we would be happy to use mutation to construct the list while running mapWith.

But after returning the new list, we then become conservative about mutation. This also makes sense: Linked lists often use structure sharing. For example:

### Iteration and Iterables

- Served by the Pot: Collections

188 **const** stack = Stack2(); stack.push(2000); stack.push(10); stack.push(5) **const** collectionSum = (collection) => { **const** iterator = collection.iterator(); **let** eachIteration, sum = 0; **while** ((eachIteration = iterator.next(), !eachIteration.done)) { sum += eachIteration.value; } **return** sum } collectionSum(stack) _//=> 2015_

Now our .iterator() method is returning an iterator object. When working with objects, we do things the object way. But having started by building functional iterators, we understand what is happening underneath the object’s scaffolding.

## **iterables**

People have been writing iterators since JavaScript was first released in the late 1990s. Since there was no particular standard way to do it, people used all sorts of methods, and their methods returned all sorts of things: Objects with various interfaces, functional iterators, you name it.

So, when a standard way to write iterators was added to the JavaScript language, it didn’t make sense to use a method like .iterator() for it: That would conflict with existing code. Instead, the language encourages new code to be written with a different name for the method that a collection object uses to return its iterator.

To ensure that the method would not conflict with any existing code, JavaScript provides a _symbol_ . Symbols are unique constants that are guaranteed not to conflict with existing strings. Symbols are a longstanding technique in programming going back to Lisp, where the GENSYM function generated… You guessed it… Symbols.[88] The expression Symbol.iterator evaluates to a special symbol representing the name of the method that objects should use if they return an iterator object.
