## **it’s always the environment**

To understand how closures are evaluated, we need to revisit environments. As we’ve said before, all functions are associated with an environment. We also hand-waved something when describing our environment. Remember that we said the environment for ((x) => (y) => x)(1) is {x: 1, ...} and that the environment for ((y) => x)(2) is {y: 2, ...}? Let’s fill in the blanks!

The environment for ((y) => x)(2) is _actually_ {y: 2, '..': {x: 1, ...}}. '..' means something like “parent” or “enclosure” or “super-environment.” It’s (x) => ...’s environment, because the function (y) => x is within (x) => ...’s body. So whenever a function is applied to arguments, its environment always has a reference to its parent environment.

And now you can guess how we evaluate ((y) => x)(2) in the environment {y: 2, '..': {x: 1, ...}}. The variable x isn’t in (y) => ...’s immediate environment, but it is in its parent’s environment, so it evaluates to 1 and that’s what ((y) => x)(2) returns even though it ended up ignoring its own argument.

(x) => x is called the I Combinator, or the _Identity Function_ . (x) => (y) => x is called the K Combinator, or _Kestrel_ . Some people get so excited by this that they write entire books about them, some are great _[a]_ , some–how shall I put this–are interesting _[b]_ if you use Ruby.

Functions can have grandparents too: (x) => (y) => (z) => x + y + z

This function does much the same thing as: (x, y, z) => x + y + z

Only you call it with (1)(2)(3) instead of (1, 2, 3). The other big difference is that you can call it with (1) and get a function back that you can later call with (2)(3). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00058))_

### Building Blocks

## **Building Blocks**

When you look at functions within functions in JavaScript, there’s a bit of a “spaghetti code” look to it. The strength of JavaScript is that you can do anything. The weakness is that you will. There are ifs, fors, returns, everything thrown higgledy piggledy together. Although you needn’t restrict yourself to a small number of simple patterns, it can be helpful to understand the patterns so that you can structure your code around some basic building blocks.

## **composition**

: One of the most basic of these building blocks is _composition_ **const** cookAndEat = (food) => eat(cook(food));

It’s really that simple: Whenever you are chaining two or more functions together, you’re composing them. You can compose them with explicit JavaScript code as we’ve just done. You can also generalize composition with the B Combinator or “compose” that we saw in Combinators and Decorators: **const** compose = (a, b) => (c) => a(b(c)); **const** cookAndEat = compose(eat, cook);

If that was all there was to it, composition wouldn’t matter much. But like many patterns, using it when it applies is only 20% of the benefit. The other 80% comes from organizing your code such that you can use it: Writing functions that can be composed in various ways.

In the recipes, we’ll look at a decorator called once: It ensures that a function can only be executed once. Thereafter, it does nothing. Once is useful for ensuring that certain side effects are not repeated. We’ll also look at maybe: It ensures that a function does nothing if it is given nothing (like null or undefined) as an argument.

Of course, you needn’t use combinators to implement either of these ideas, you can use if statements. But once and maybe compose, so you can chain them together as you see fit:

- **const** actuallyTransfer= (from, to, amount) => _// do something_ **const** invokeTransfer = once(maybe(actuallyTransfer(...))); _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00086))_

### Garbage, Garbage Everywhere

- Composing and Decomposing Data

108

## **so why arrays**

If [first, ...rest] is so slow, why does JavaScript use arrays instead of making everything a linked list?

Well, linked lists are fast for a few things, like taking the front element off a list, and taking the remainder of a list. But not for iterating over a list: Pointer chasing through memory is quite a bit slower than incrementing an index. In addition to the extra fetches to dereference pointers, pointer chasing suffers from cache misses. And if you want an arbitrary item from a list, you have to iterate through the list element by element, whereas with the indexed array you just fetch it.

We have avoided discussing rebinding and mutating values, but if we want to change elements of our lists, the naïve linked list implementation suffers as well: When we take the cdr of a linked list, we are sharing the elements. If we make any change other than cons-ing a new element to the front, we are changing both the new list and the old list.

Arrays avoid this problem by pessimistically copying all the references whenever we extract an element or sequence of elements from them (We’ll see this explained later in Mutation).

For these and other reasons, almost all languages today make it possible to use a fast array or vector type that is optimized for iteration, and even Lisp now has a variety of data structures that are optimized for specific use cases.

## **summary**

Although we showed how to use tail calls to map and fold over arrays with [first, ...rest], in reality this is not how it ought to be done. But it is an extremely simple illustration of how recursion works when you have a self-similar means of constructing a data structure. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00157))_

### Copy on Write

- Composing and Decomposing Data

138 **const** childList = rest(parentList); set(2, "three", parentList); set(0, "two", childList); parentList _//=> {"first":1,"rest":{"first":"two","rest":{"first":"three","rest":{"first":\_ {},"rest":{}}}}} childList _//=> {"first":"two","rest":{"first":"three","rest":{"first":{},"rest":{}}}}_ Our new at and set functions behave similarly to array[index] and array[index] = value. The main difference is that array[index] = value evaluates to value, while set(index, value, list) evaluates to the modified list.

## **copy-on-read**

So back to the problem of structure sharing. One strategy for avoiding problems is to be _pessimistic_ . Whenever we take the rest of a list, make a copy.

**const** rest = ({first, rest}) => copy(rest); **const** parentList = { first: 1, rest: { first: 2, rest: { first: 3, rest: EMPTY }\ }}; **const** childList = rest(parentList); **const** newParentList = set(2, "three", parentList); set(0, "two", childList); parentList _//=> {"first":1,"rest":{"first":2,"rest":{"first":"three","rest":{"first":{},"\_ rest":{}}}}} childList //=> {"first":"two","rest":{"first":3,"rest":{"first":{},"rest":{}}}} This strategy is called “copy-on-read”, because when we attempt the parent to “read” the value of a child of the list, we make a copy and read the copy of the child. Thereafter, we can write to the parent or the copy of the child freely.

As we expected, making a copy lets us modify the copy without interfering with the original. This is, however, expensive. Sometimes we don’t need to make a copy because we won’t be modifying the list. Our mapWith function would be very expensive if we make a copy every time we call rest(node).

There’s also a bug: What happens when we modify the first element of a list? But before we fix that, let’s try being lazy about copying. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00191))_
