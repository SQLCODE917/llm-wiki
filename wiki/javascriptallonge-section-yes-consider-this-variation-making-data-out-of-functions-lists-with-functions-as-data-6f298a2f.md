## Statements

- Here's another look at linked lists using POJOs. We use the term rest instead of second , but it's otherwise identical to what we have above: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01377))_
- Presto, we can use pure functions to represent a linked list . And with care, we can do amazing things like use functions to represent numbers, build more complex data structures like trees, and in fact, anything that can be computed can be computed using just functions and nothing else. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01385))_
- We used functions to replace arrays and POJOs, but we still use JavaScript's built-in operators to test for equality ( === ) and to branch ?: . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01387))_

## Technical atoms

### Technical frame 1: Yes. Consider this variation: / Making Data Out Of Functions / lists with functions as data

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01385))_

> Presto, we can use pure functions to represent a linked list . And with care, we can do amazing things like use functions to represent numbers, build more complex data structures like trees, and in fact, anything that can be computed can be computed using just functions and nothing else.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01378))_

```
const first = ({first, rest}) => first,
rest
= ({first, rest}) => rest,
pair = (first, rest) => ({first, rest}),
EMPTY = ({});
const l123 = pair(1, pair(2, pair(3, EMPTY)));
first(l123)
//=> 1
first(rest(l123))
//=> 2
first(rest(rest(l123)))
//=3
```

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01380))_

```
const length = (aPair) =>
aPair === EMPTY
? 0
: 1 + length(rest(aPair));
length(l123)
//=> 3
const reverse = (aPair, delayed = EMPTY) =>
aPair === EMPTY
? delayed
: reverse(rest(aPair), pair(first(aPair), delayed));
const mapWith = (fn, aPair, delayed = EMPTY) =>
aPair === EMPTY
? reverse(delayed)
: mapWith(fn, rest(aPair), pair(fn(first(aPair)), delayed));
const doubled = mapWith((x) => x * 2, l123);
first(doubled)
//=> 2
first(rest(doubled))
//=> 4
first(rest(rest(doubled)))
//=> 6
Can we do the same with the linked lists we build out of functions? Yes:
const first = K,
rest
= K(I),
pair = V,
EMPTY = (() => {});
const l123 = pair(1)(pair(2)(pair(3)(EMPTY)));
```

l123(first)
//=> 1
l123(rest)(first)

```
//=> 2
return l123(rest)(rest)(first)
//=> 3
We write them in a backwards way, but they seem to work. How about

const length = (aPair) =>

const mapWith = (fn, aPair, delayed = EMPTY) =>

doubled(first)
//=> 2
doubled(rest)(first)
//=> 4
doubled(rest)(rest)(first)
//=> 6
