What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about start:

## Statements

### A Rich Aroma: Basic Numbers

- A Rich Aroma: Basic Numbers

2 all numbers are base ten. If we start a literal with a zero, it is an octal literal. So the literal 042 is 42 base 8, which is actually 34 base 10.

Internally, both 042 and 34 have the same representation, as double-precision floating point[13] numbers. A computer’s internal representation for numbers is important to understand. The machine’s representation of a number almost never lines up perfectly with our understanding of how a number behaves, and thus there will be places where the computer’s behaviour surprises us if we don’t know a little about what it’s doing “under the hood.” For example, the largest integer JavaScript can safely[14] handle is 9007199254740991, or 2[‘53‘] - 1. Like most programming languages, JavaScript does not allow us to use commas to separate groups of digits.

## **floating**

Most programmers never encounter the limit on the magnitude of an integer. But we mentioned that numbers are represented internally as floating point, meaning that they need not be just integers. We can, for example, write 1.5 or 33.33, and JavaScript represents these literals as floating point numbers.

It’s tempting to think we now have everything we need to do things like handle amounts of money, but as the late John Belushi would say, “Nooooooooooooooooooooo.” A computer’s internal representation for a floating point number is binary, while our literal number was in base ten. This makes no meaningful difference for integers, but it does for fractions, because some fractions base 10 do not have exact representations base 2.

One of the most oft-repeated examples is this:

- 1.0 _//=> 1_

- 1.0 + 1.0 _//=> 2_

- 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 _//=> 3_ However:

> 14Implementations of JavaScript are free to handle larger numbers. For example, if you type 9007199254740991 + 9007199254740991 into node.js, it will happily report that the answer is 18014398509481982. But code that depends upon numbers larger than 9007199254740991 may not be reliable when moved to other implementations. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00038))_

### Combinators and Function Decorators

- The first sip: Basic Functions

46

In this book, we will be using a looser definition of “combinator:” Higher-order pure functions that take only functions as arguments and return a function. We won’t be strict about using only previously defined combinators in their construction.

Let’s start with a useful combinator: Most programmers call it _Compose_ , although the logicians call it the B combinator or “Bluebird.” Here is the typical[37] programming implementation:

- **const** compose = (a, b) => (c) => a(b(c)) Let’s say we have: **const** addOne = (number) => number + 1; **const** doubleOf = (number) => number * 2;

With compose, anywhere you would write **const** doubleOfAddOne = (number) => doubleOf(addOne(number));

You could also write: **const** doubleOfAddOne = compose(doubleOf, addOne);

This is, of course, just one example of many. You’ll find lots more perusing the recipes in this book. While some programmers believe “There Should Only Be One Way To Do It,” having combinators available as well as explicitly writing things out with lots of symbols and keywords has some advantages when used judiciously.

## **a balanced statement about combinators**

Code that uses a lot of combinators tends to name the verbs and adverbs (like doubleOf, addOne, and compose) while avoiding language keywords and the names of nouns (like number). So one perspective is that combinators are useful when you want to emphasize what you’re doing and how it fits together, and more explicit code is useful when you want to emphasize what you’re working with.

## **function decorators**

A _function decorator_ is a higher-order function that takes one function as an argument, returns another function, and the returned function is a variation of the argument function. Here’s a ridiculously simple decorator:[38] > 37As we’ll discuss later, this implementation of the B Combinator is correct in languages like Scheme, but for truly general-purpose use in JavaScript, it needs to correctly manage the function context.

> 38 We’ll see later why an even more useful version would be written (fn) => (...args) => !fn(...args) _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00083))_

### Functional Iterators

- Composing and Decomposing Data

150 **const** FibonacciIterator = () => { **let** previous = 0, current = 1; **return** () => { **const** value = current; [previous, current] = [current, current + previous]; **return** {done: **false** , value}; }; }; **const** fib = FibonacciIterator() fib().value _//=> 1_ fib().value _//=> 1_ fib().value _//=> 2_ fib().value _//=> 3_ fib().value _//=> 5_

A function that starts with a seed and expands it into a data structure is called an _unfold_ . It’s the opposite of a fold. It’s possible to write a generic unfold mechanism, but let’s pass on to what we can do with unfolded iterators.

For starters, we can map an iterator, just like we map a collection: **const** mapIteratorWith = (fn, iterator) => () => { **const** {done, value} = iterator(); **return** ({done, value: done ? **undefined** : fn(value)}); } **const** squares = mapIteratorWith((x) => x * x, NumberIterator(1)); squares().value _//=> 1_ squares().value _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00205))_

### Making Data Out Of Functions

- 155

Composing and Decomposing Data **const** EMPTY = {}; **const** OneTwoThree = { first: 1, rest: { first: 2, rest: { first: 3, rest: EMPTY \ } } };

OneTwoThree.first _//=> 1_ OneTwoThree.rest.first _//=> 2_

OneTwoThree.rest.rest.first _//=> 3_ **const** length = (node, delayed = 0) => node === EMPTY ? delayed : length(node.rest, delayed + 1); length(OneTwoThree) _//=> 3_

A very long time ago, mathematicians like Alonzo Church, Moses Schönfinkel, Alan Turning, and Haskell Curry and asked themselves if we really needed all these features to perform computations. They searched for a radically simpler set of tools that could accomplish all of the same things.

They established that arbitrary computations could be represented a small set of axiomatic components. For example, we don’t need arrays to represent lists, or even POJOs to represent nodes in a linked list. We can model lists just using functions.

To Mock a Mockingbird[76] established the metaphor of songbirds for the combinators, and ever since then logicians have called the K combinator a “kestrel,” the B combinator a “bluebird,” and so forth.

The oscin.es[77] library contains code for all of the standard combinators and for experimenting using the standard notation.

Let’s start with some of the building blocks of combinatory logic, the K, I, and V combinators, nicknamed the “Kestrel”, the “Idiot Bird”, and the “Vireo:” > 76http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192801422/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative= 390957&creativeASIN=0192801422

### Interactive Generators

## **Interactive Generators**

We used generators to build iterators that maintain implicit state. We saw how to use them for recursive unfolds and state machines. But there are other times we want to build functions that maintain implicit state. Let’s start by looking at a very simple example of a function that can be written statefully.

**Coffee and Chess**

Consider, for example, the moves in a game. The moves a player makes are a stream of values, just like the contents of an array can be consider a stream of values. But of course, iterating over a stream of moves requires us to wait for the game to be over so we know what moves were made.

Let’s take a look at a very simple example, naughts and crosses[99] (We really ought to do something like Chess, but that might be a little out of scope for this chapter). To save space, we’ll ignore rotations and reflections, and we’ll model the first player’s moves as a stream.

The first player will always be o, and they will always place their chequer in the top-left corner, coincidentally numbered o:
