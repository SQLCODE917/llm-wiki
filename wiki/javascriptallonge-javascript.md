## Statements by source section

### A Pull of the Lever: Prefaces / About JavaScript Allongé

- JavaScript Allongé is a first and foremost, a book about programming with functions . It's written in JavaScript, because JavaScript hits the perfect sweet spot of being both widely used, and of having proper first-class functions with lexical scope. If those terms seem unfamiliar, don't worry: JavaScript Allongé takes great delight in explaining what they mean and why they matter. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00016))_

- JavaScript Allongé begins at the beginning, with values and expressions, and builds from there to discuss types, identity, functions, closures, scopes, collections, iterators, and many more subjects up to working with classes and instances. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00017))_

- It also provides recipes for using functions to write software that is simpler, cleaner, and less complicated than alternative approaches that are object-centric or code-centric. JavaScript idioms like function combinators and decorators leverage JavaScript's power to make code easier to read, modify, debug and refactor. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00018))_

### A Pull of the Lever: Prefaces / About JavaScript Allongé / why the 'six' edition?

- Prior to ECMAScript 2015, JavaScript did not include many features that programmers have discovered are vital to writing great software. For example, JavaScript did not include block-structured variables. Over time, programmers discovered ways to roll their own versions of important features. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00022))_

- And the variable i is scoped locally to the code within the braces. Prior to ECMAScript 2015, JavaScript did not support block-structuring, so programmers borrowed a trick from the Scheme programming language, and would write: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00025))_

- Prior to ECMAScript 2015, JavaScript did not support collecting a variable number of arguments into a parameter, so programmers would take advantage of an awkward work-around and write things like: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00030))_

### A Pull of the Lever: Prefaces / About JavaScript Allongé / that's nice. is that the only reason?

- But there's more to it than that . The original JavaScript Allongé was not just written to teach JavaScript: It was written to describe certain ideas in programming: Working with small, independent entities that compose together to make bigger programs. Thus, the focus on things like writing decorators. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00043))_

### A Pull of the Lever: Prefaces / What JavaScript Allongé is. And isn't.

- JavaScript Allongé is a book about programming with functions. From functions flow many ideas, from decorators to methods to delegation to mixins, and onwards in so many fruitful directions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00052))_

- But while JavaScript Allongé attempts to be provocative, it is not prescriptive . There is absolutely no suggestion that any of the techniques shown here are the only way to do something, the best way, or even an acceptable way to write programs that are intended to be used, read, and maintained by others. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00054))_

- JavaScript Allongé does not attempt to address the question of JavaScript best practices in the wider context of software development, because JavaScript Allongé isn't a book about practicing, it's a book about thinking. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00063))_

### ECMAScript 6 has three major groups of features:

- With ECMAScript 6, JavaScript has become much larger as a language. JavaScript Allongé, the 'Six' Edition is both a comprehensive tour of its features and a rich collection of techniques for making better use of them. You will learn much about functional programming and object-oriented programming. And you'll do so via ES6 code, handed to you in small, easily digestible pieces. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00079))_

### ECMAScript 6 has three major groups of features: / Forewords to the First Edition / michael fogus

- As a staunch advocate of functional programming, much of what Reg has written rings true to me. While not exclusively a book about functional programming, JavaScript Allongé will provide a solid foundation for functional techniques. However, you'll not be beaten about the head and neck with dogma. Instead, every section is motivated by relevant dialog and fortified with compelling source examples. As an author of programming books I admire what Reg has managed to accomplish and I envy the fine reader who finds JavaScript Allongé via some darkened channel in the Internet sprawl and reads it for the first time. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00087))_

### ECMAScript 6 has three major groups of features: / About The Sample PDF

- This sample edition of the book includes just a portion of the complete book. Buying the book in progress entitles you to free updates, so download it today 7 ! Besides, there's really no risk at all . If you read JavaScript Allongé, The 'six' edition and it doesn't blow your mind, your money will be cheerfully refunded. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00093))_

### Prelude: Values and Expressions over Coffee / values and identity

- First, sometimes, the cups are of different kinds. One is a demitasse, the other a mug. This corresponds to comparing two things in JavaScript that have different types . For example, the string "2" is not the same thing as the number 2 . Strings and numbers are different types, so strings and numbers are never identical: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00118))_

- Second, sometimes, the cups are of the same type-perhaps two espresso cups-but they have different contents. One holds a single, one a double. This corresponds to comparing two JavaScript values that have the same type but different 'content.' For example, the number 5 is not the same thing as the number 2 . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00120))_

### A Rich Aroma: Basic Numbers

- For example, the largest integer JavaScript can safely 14 handle is 9007199254740991 , or 2 '53' - 1 . Like most programming languages, JavaScript does not allow us to use commas to separate groups of digits. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00145))_

### A Rich Aroma: Basic Numbers / operations on numbers

- As we've seen, JavaScript has many common arithmetic operators. We can create expressions that look very much like mathematical expressions, for example we can write 1 + 1 or 2 * 3 or 42 34 or even 6 / 2 . These can be combined to make more complex expressions, like 2 * 5 + 1 . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00157))_

- In JavaScript, operators have an order of precedence designed to mimic the way humans typically parse written arithmetic. So: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00158))_

- JavaScript treats the expressions as if we had written (2 * 5) + 1 and 1 + (5 * 2) , because the * operator has a higher precedence than the + operator. JavaScript has many more operators. In a sense, they behave like little functions. If we write 1 + 2 , this is conceptually similar to writing plus(1, 2) (assuming we have a function that adds two numbers bound to the name plus , of course). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00160))_

### The first sip: Basic Functions / As Little As Possible About Functions, But No Less

- In JavaScript, functions are values, but they are also much more than simple numbers, strings, or even complex data structures like trees or maps. Functions represent computations to be performed. Like numbers, strings, and arrays, they have a representation. Let's start with the second simplest possible function. 16 In JavaScript, it looks like this: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00168))_

### The first sip: Basic Functions / As Little As Possible About Functions, But No Less / commas

- The comma operator in JavaScript is interesting. It takes two arguments, evaluates them both, and itself evaluates to the value of the right-hand argument. In other words: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00201))_

- This is useful when trying to do things that might involve side-effects , but we'll get to that later. In most cases, JavaScript does not care whether things are separated by spaces, tabs, or line breaks. So we can also write: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00205))_

### Or even: / the simplest possible block / undefined

- In JavaScript, the absence of a value is written undefined , and it means there is no value. It will crop up again. undefined is its own type of value, and it acts like a value type: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00217))_

- Like numbers, booleans and strings, JavaScript can print out the value undefined . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00220))_

- 18 Sometimes, you will find JavaScript that has statements that are separated by newlines without semi-colons. This works because JavaScript has a feature that can infer where the semi-colons should be most of the time. We will not take advantage of this feature, but it's helpful to know it exists. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00223))_

### Or even: / void

- We've seen that JavaScript represents an undefined value by typing undefined , and we've generated undefined values in two ways: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00226))_

### Or even: / back on the block

- 21 You can also separate statements with line breaks. Readers who follow internet flame-fests may be aware of something called automatic semicolon insertion. Basically, there's a step where JavaScript looks at your code and follows some rules to guess where you meant to put semicolons in should you leave them out. This feature was originally created as a kind of helpful error-correction. Some programmers argue that since it's part of the language's definition, it's fair game to write code that exploits it, so they deliberately omit any semicolon that JavaScript will insert for them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00246))_

### And also: / Ah. I'd Like to Have an Argument, Please. 22 / call by value

- We'll see below that while JavaScript always calls by value, the notion of a 'value' has additional subtlety. But before we do, let's look at variables. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00296))_

### And also: / Ah. I'd Like to Have an Argument, Please. 22 / call by sharing

- We said that JavaScript binds names to values, but we didn't say what it means to bind a name to a value. Now we can elaborate: When JavaScript binds a value-type to a name, it makes a copy of the value and places the copy in the environment. As you recall, value types like strings and numbers are identical to each other if they have the same content. So JavaScript can make as many copies of strings, numbers, or booleans as it wishes. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00322))_

- Whatabout reference types? JavaScript does not place copies of reference values in any environment. JavaScript places references to reference types in environments, and when the value needs to be used, JavaScript uses the reference to obtain the original. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00324))_

### And also: / Closures and Scope / shadowy variables from a shadowy planet

- When evaluating x + y + z , JavaScript will find x and y in the great-grandparent scope and z in the parent scope. The x in the great-great-grandparent scope is ignored, as are both w s. When a variable has the same name as an ancestor environment's binding, it is said to shadow the ancestor. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00375))_

### And also: / Closures and Scope / which came first, the chicken or the egg?

- JavaScript always has the notion of at least one environment we do not control: A global environment in which many useful things are bound such as libraries full of standard functions. So when you invoke ((x) => x)(1) in the REPL, its full environment is going to look like this: {x: 1, '..': global environment } . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00380))_

### And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving / inside-out

- 29 JavaScript programmers regularly use the idea of writing an expression that denotes a function and then immediately applying it to arguments. Explaining the pattern, Ben Alman coined the term [Immediately Invoked Function Expression][iife] for it, often abbreviated 'IIFE.' _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00404))_

### And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving / const

- JavaScript gives us a way to do that, the const keyword. We'll learn a lot more about const in future chapters, but here's the most important thing we can do with const : _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00420))_

### And also: / Naming Functions / the function keyword

- JavaScript does have a syntax for naming a function, we use the function keyword. Until ECMAScript 2015 was created, function was the usual syntax for writing functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00503))_

### And also: / Naming Functions / function declaration caveats 34

- Function declarations are formally only supposed to be made at what we might call the 'top level' of a function. Although some JavaScript environments permit the following code, this example is technically illegal and definitely a bad idea: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00548))_

### And also: / Combinators and Function Decorators / higher-order functions

- As we've seen, JavaScript functions take values as arguments and return values. JavaScript functions are values, so JavaScript functions can take functions as arguments, return functions, or both. Generally speaking, a function that either takes functions as arguments, or returns a function, or both, is referred to as a 'higher-order' function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00557))_

Strings, numbers, and booleans are examples of what JavaScript calls 'value' or 'primitive' types. We'll use both terms interchangeably.

> It's tempting to think we now have everything we need to do things like handle amounts of money, but as the late John Belushi would say, 'Nooooooooooooooooooooo.' A computer's internal representation for a floating point number is binary, while our literal number was in base ten. This makes no meaningful difference for integers, but it does for fractions, because some fractions base 10 do not have exact representations base 2.

> What!? Why didn't it type back () => 0 for us? This seems to break our rule that if an expression is also a value, JavaScript will give the same value back to us. What's going on? The simplest and easiest answer is that although the JavaScript interpreter does indeed return that value, displaying it on the screen is a slightly different matter. [Function] is a choice made by the people who wrote Node.js, the JavaScript environment that hosts the JavaScript REPL. If you try the same thing in a br
