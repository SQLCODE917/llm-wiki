# Works Just Fine, Because Arguments[0

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about works just fine, because arguments[0:

## Statements

### And also: / Magic Names / magic names and fat arrows

- This works just fine, because arguments[0] refers to the 3 we passed to the function row . Our 'fat arrow' function (column) => column * arguments[0] doesn't bind arguments when it's invoked. But if we rewrite row to use the function keyword, it stops working: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00627))_


## Technical atoms

### Technical atom 1

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00236))_

> We said that the function returns the result of evaluating a block , and we said that a block is a (possibly empty) list of JavaScript statements separated by semicolons. 21

| 19 | Experienced JavaScript programmers are aware that there's a fourth way, using a function argument. This was actually the preferred mechanism until void became commonplace. |
| 20 | As an exercise for the reader, we suggest you ask your friendly neighbourhood programming language designer or human factors subjectmatter expert to explain why a keyword called void is used to generate an undefined value, instead of calling them both void or both undefined .

back on the block
Back to our function. We evaluated this:

combinators
The word 'combinator' has a precise technical meaning in mathematics:
'A combinator is a higher-order function that uses only function application and earlier defined combinators to define a result from its arguments.'-Wikipedia 35
If we were learning Combinatorial Logic, we'd start with the most basic combinators like S , K , and I , and work up from there to practical combinators. We'd learn that the fundamental combinators are named after birds following the example of Raymond Smullyan's famous book To Mock a Mockingbird 36 .

| 37 | As we'll discuss later, this implementation of the B Combinator is correct in languages like Scheme, but for truly general-purpose use in JavaScript, it needs to correctly manage the function context. |
| 38 | We'll see later why an even more useful version would be written (fn) => (...args) => !fn(...args) |

function decorators
A function decorator is a higher-order function that takes one function as an argument, returns another function, and the returned function is a variation of the argument function. Here's a ridiculously simple decorator: 38
