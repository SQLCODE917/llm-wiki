# Idea

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about idea:

## Statements

### A Pull of the Lever: Prefaces / About JavaScript Allongé / that's nice. is that the only reason?

- Introducing so many new ideas did require a major rethink of the way the book was organized. And introducing these new ideas did add substantially to its bulk. But even so, in a way it is still explaining the exact same original idea that programs are built out of small, flexible functions composed together. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00048))_

### A Pull of the Lever: Prefaces / What JavaScript Allongé is. And isn't.

- The focus in this book on the underlying ideas, what we might call the fundamentals, and how they combine to form new ideas. The intention is to improve the way we think about programs. That's a good thing. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00053))_

### The first sip: Basic Functions / As Little As Possible About Functions, But No Less / functions that return values and evaluate expressions

- Well, the last one's a doozy, but still, the general idea is this: We can make a function that returns a value by putting the value to the right of the arrow. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00190))_

### And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving / const

- Amazing how such an important idea-naming functions-can be explained en passant in just a few words. That emphasizes one of the things JavaScript gets really, really right: Functions as 'first class entities. ' Functions are values that can be bound to names like any other value, passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and so forth. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00433))_

### And also: / Magic Names / magic names and fat arrows

- 44 Yes, we also used the name mapWith for working with ordinary collections elsewhere. If we were writing a library of functions, we would have to disambiguate the two kinds of mapping functions with special names, namespaces, or modules. But for the purposes of discussing ideas, we can use the same name twice in two different contexts. It's the same idea, after all. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00628))_

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Self-Similarity

- We saw that the basic idea that putting an array together with a literal array expression was the reverse or opposite of taking it apart with a destructuring assignment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00885))_

### Recipes with Data / mapWith

- 82 Yes, we also used the name mapWith for working with ordinary collections elsewhere. If we were writing a library of functions, we would have to disambiguate the two kinds of mapping functions with special names, namespaces, or modules. But for the purposes of discussing ideas, we can use the same name twice in two different contexts. It's the same idea, after all. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01440))_

### Like this: / operations on ordered collections

- 89 Yes, we also used the name mapWith for working with ordinary collections elsewhere. If we were writing a library of functions, we would have to disambiguate the two kinds of mapping functions with special names, namespaces, or modules. But for the purposes of discussing ideas, we can use the same name twice in two different contexts. It's the same idea, after all. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01588))_


## Technical atoms

### Technical frame 1: The first sip: Basic Functions / As Little As Possible About Functions, But No Less / functions that return values and evaluate expressions

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00193))_

> Yes we can. We can put any expression to the right of the arrow. For example, (() => 0)() is an expression. Can we put it to the right of an arrow, like this: () => (() => 0)() ?

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00192))_

```
(() => 1 + 1)()
//=> 2
(() => "Hello, " + "JavaScript")()
//=> "Hello, JavaScript"
(() => Infinity * Infinity)()
//=> Infinity
```

### Technical frame 2: And also: / Magic Names / magic names and fat arrows

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00631))_

> Although this example is clearly unrealistic, there is a general design principle that deserves attention. Sometimes, a function is meant to be used as a Big-F function. It has a name, it is called by different pieces of code, it's a first-class entity in the code.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00629))_

```
const row = function () {
return mapWith(
function (column) { return column * arguments[0] },
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
)
}
row(3)
//=> [1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121,144]
```

### Technical frame 3: Recipes with Data / mapWith

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01442))_

> If we didn't use mapWith , we'd could have also used callRight with map to accomplish the same result:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01441))_

```
const squaresOf = mapWith(n => n * n);
squaresOf([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
//=> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

### Technical frame 4: Like this: / operations on ordered collections

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01590))_

> This illustrates the general pattern of working with ordered collections: We make them iterables , meaning that they have a [Symbol.iterator] method, that returns an iterator . An iterator is also an object, but with a .next() method that is invoked repeatedly to obtain the elements in order.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01589))_

```
const mapWith = (fn, collection) =>
({
[Symbol.iterator] () {
const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();
return {
next () {
const {done, value} = iterator.next();
return ({done, value: done ? undefined : fn(value)});
}
}
}
});
```
