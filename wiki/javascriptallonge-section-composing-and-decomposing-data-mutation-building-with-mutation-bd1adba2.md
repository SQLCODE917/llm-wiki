# Composing and Decomposing Data / Mutation / building with mutation

## Statements

- As noted, one pattern is to be more liberal about mutation when building a data structure. Consider our copy algorithm. Without mutation, a copy of a linked list can be made in constant space by reversing a reverse of the list: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01153))_
- If we want to make a copy of a linked list without iterating over it twice and making a copy we discard later, we can use mutation: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01155))_
- This algorithm makes copies of nodes as it goes, and mutates the last node in the list so that it can splice the next one on. Adding a node to an existing list is risky, as we saw when considering the fact that OneToFive and ThreeToFive share the same nodes. But when we're in the midst of creating a brand new list, we aren't sharing any nodes with any other lists, and we can afford to be more liberal about using mutation to save space and/or time. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01157))_
