A Pull of the Lever: Prefaces

## **Forewords to the First Edition**

## **michael fogus**

As a life-long bibliophile and long-time follower of Reg’s online work, I was excited when he started writing books. However, I’m very conservative about books – let’s just say that if there was an aftershave scented to the essence of “Used Book Store” then I would be first in line to buy. So as you might imagine I was “skeptical” about the decision to release JavaScript Allongé as an ongoing ebook, with a pay-what-you-want model. However, Reg sent me a copy of his book and I was humbled. Not only was this a great book, but it was also a great way to write and distribute books. Having written books myself, I know the pain of soliciting and receiving feedback.

The act of writing is an iterative process with (very often) tight revision loops. However, the process of soliciting feedback, gathering responses, sending out copies, waiting for people to actually read it (if they ever do), receiving feedback and then ultimately making sense out of how to use it takes weeks and sometimes months. On more than one occasion I’ve found myself attempting to reify feedback with content that either no longer existed or was changed beyond recognition. However, with the Leanpub model the read-feedback-change process is extremely efficient, leaving in its wake a quality book that continues to get better as others likewise read and comment into infinitude.

In the case of JavaScript Allongé, you’ll find the Leanpub model a shining example of effectiveness. Reg has crafted (and continues to craft) not only an interesting book from the perspective of a connoisseur, but also an entertaining exploration into some of the most interesting aspects of his art. No matter how much of an expert you think you are, JavaScript Allongé has something to teach you… about coffee. I kid.

As a staunch advocate of functional programming, much of what Reg has written rings true to me. While not exclusively a book about functional programming, JavaScript Allongé will provide a solid foundation for functional techniques. However, you’ll not be beaten about the head and neck with dogma. Instead, every section is motivated by relevant dialog and fortified with compelling source examples. As an author of programming books I admire what Reg has managed to accomplish and I envy the fine reader who finds JavaScript Allongé via some darkened channel in the Internet sprawl and reads it for the first time.

Enjoy.

A different kind of language requires a different kind of book.

JavaScript holds surprising depths–its scoping rules are neither strictly lexical nor strictly dynamic, and it supports procedural, object-oriented (in several flavors!), and functional programming. Many

**Mathematics and Coffee**

In computer science, a literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. Almost all programming languages have notations for atomic values such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings, and usually for booleans and characters; some also have notations for elements of enumerated types and compound values such as arrays, records, and objects. An anonymous function is a literal for the function type.— Wikipedia[12] JavaScript, like most languages, has a collection of literals. We saw that an expression consisting solely of numbers, like 42, is a literal. It represents the number forty-two, which is 42 base 10. Not

### Closures and Scope

- The first sip: Basic Functions

The first function is the result of currying _[a]_ the second function. Calling a curried function with only some of its arguments is sometimes called partial application _[b]_ . Some programming languages automatically curry and partially evaluate functions without the need to manually nest them.

## **shadowy variables from a shadowy planet**

An interesting thing happens when a variable has the same name as an ancestor environment’s variable. Consider:

- (x) => (x, y) => x + y

The function (x, y) => x + y is a pure function, because its x is defined within its own environment. Although its parent also defines an x, it is ignored when evaluating x + y. JavaScript always searches for a binding starting with the functions own environment and then each parent in turn until it finds one. The same is true of: (x) => (x, y) => (w, z) => (w) => x + y + z

When evaluating x + y + z, JavaScript will find x and y in the great-grandparent scope and z in the parent scope. The x in the great-great-grandparent scope is ignored, as are both ws. When a variable has the same name as an ancestor environment’s binding, it is said to _shadow_ the ancestor.

This is often a good thing.

## **which came first, the chicken or the egg?**

This behaviour of pure functions and closures has many, many consequences that can be exploited to write software. We are going to explore them in some detail as well as look at some of the other mechanisms JavaScript provides for working with variables and mutable state.

But before we do so, there’s one final question: Where does the ancestry start? If there’s no other code in a file, what is (x) => x’s parent environment? _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00059))_

### That Constant Coffee Craving

## **That Constant Coffee Craving**

Up to now, all we’ve really seen are _anonymous functions_ , functions that don’t have a name. This feels very different from programming in most other languages, where the focus is on naming functions, methods, and procedures. Naming things is a critical part of programming, but all we’ve seen so far is how to name arguments.

There are other ways to name things in JavaScript, but before we learn some of those, let’s see how to use what we already have to name things. Let’s revisit a very simple example: (diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265

What is this “3.14159265” number? PI[28] , obviously. We’d like to name it so that we can write something like: (diameter) => diameter * PI

In order to bind 3.14159265 to the name PI, we’ll need a function with a parameter of PI applied to an argument of 3.14159265. If we put our function expression in parentheses, we can apply it to the argument of 3.14159265:

((PI) => _// ????_ )(3.14159265) What do we put inside our new function that binds 3.14159265 to the name PI when evaluated? Our circumference function, of course:

((PI) => (diameter) => diameter * PI )(3.14159265) This expression, when evaluated, returns a function that calculates circumferences. That sounds bad, but when we think about it, (diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265 is also an expression, that when evaluated, returns a function that calculates circumferences. All of our “functions” are expressions. This one has a few more moving parts, that’s all. But we can use it just like (diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265.

Let’s test it:

### Maybe

- Recipes with Basic Functions

## **Maybe**

A common problem in programming is checking for null or undefined (hereafter called “nothing,” while all other values including 0, [] and false will be called “something”). Languages like JavaScript do not strongly enforce the notion that a particular variable or particular property be something, so programs are often written to account for values that may be nothing.

This recipe concerns a pattern that is very common: A function fn takes a value as a parameter, and its behaviour by design is to do nothing if the parameter is nothing: **const** isSomething = (value) => value !== **null** && value !== **void** 0; **const** checksForSomething = (value) => { **if** (isSomething(value)) { _// function's true logic_ } } Alternately, the function may be intended to work with any value, but the code calling the function wishes to emulate the behaviour of doing nothing by design when given nothing: **var** something = isSomething(value) ? doesntCheckForSomething(value) : value;

Naturally, there’s a function decorator recipe for that, borrowed from Haskell’s maybe monad[50] , Ruby’s andand[51] , and CoffeeScript’s existential method invocation: **const** maybe = (fn) => **function** (...args) { **if** (args.length === 0) { **return** } **else** { **for** ( **let** arg **of** args) { **if** (arg == **null** ) **return** ; } > 50https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)#The_Maybe_monad > 51https://github.com/raganwald/andand _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00108))_

### Garbage, Garbage Everywhere

- Composing and Decomposing Data

106

In broad terms, this means that a single 36-bit word could store two separate 15-bit values and it was very fast to save and retrieve pairs of values. If you had two 15-bit values and wished to write them to the register, the CONS macro would take the values and write them to a 36-bit word.

Thus, CONS put two values together, CAR extracted one, and CDR extracted the other. Lisp’s basic data type is often said to be the list, but in actuality it was the “cons cell,” the term used to describe two 15-bit values stored in one word. The 15-bit values were used as pointers that could refer to a location in memory, so in effect, a cons cell was a little data structure with two pointers to other cons cells.

Lists were represented as linked lists of cons cells, with each cell’s head pointing to an element and the tail pointing to another cons cell.

Having these instructions be very fast was important to those early designers: They were working on one of the first high-level languages (COBOL and FORTRAN being the others), and computers in the late 1950s were extremely small and slow by today’s standards. Although the 704 used core memory, it still used vacuum tubes for its logic. Thus, the design of programming languages and algorithms was driven by what could be accomplished with limited memory and performance.

Here’s the scheme in JavaScript, using two-element arrays to represent cons cells: **const** cons = (a, d) => [a, d], car = ([a, d]) => a, cdr = ([a, d]) => d;

We can make a list by calling cons repeatedly, and terminating it with null: **const** oneToFive = cons(1, cons(2, cons(3, cons(4, cons(5, **null** )))));

## oneToFive

_//=> [1,[2,[3,[4,[5,null]]]]]_ Notice that though JavaScript displays our list as if it is composed of arrays nested within each other like Russian Dolls, in reality the arrays refer to each other with references, so [1,[2,[3,[4,[5,null]]]]] is actually more like: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00155))_

### Reassignment

- Composing and Decomposing Data

## **Reassignment**

Like some imperative programming languages, JavaScript allows you to re-assign the value bound : to parameters. We saw this earlier in rebinding

By default, JavaScript permits us to _rebind_ new values to names bound with a parameter. For example, we can write: **const** evenStevens = (n) => { **if** (n === 0) { **return true** ; } **else if** (n == 1) { **return false** ; } **else** { n = n - 2; **return** evenStevens(n); } } evenStevens(42) _//=> true_

The line n = n - 2; _rebinds_ a new value to the name n. We will discuss this at much greater length in Reassignment, but long before we do, let’s try a similar thing with a name bound using const. We’ve already bound evenStevens using const, let’s try rebinding it: evenStevens = (n) => { **if** (n === 0) { **return true** ; } **else if** (n == 1) { **return false** ; } **else** { **return** evenStevens(n - 2); } } _//=> ERROR, evenStevens is read-only_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00177))_
