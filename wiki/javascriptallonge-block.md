# Block

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about block:

## Statements

### A Pull of the Lever: Prefaces / About JavaScript Allongé / why the 'six' edition?

- ECMAScript 2015 (formerly called ECMAScript 6 or 'ES6'), is ushering in a very large number of improvements to the way programmers can write small, powerful components and combine them into larger, fully featured programs. Features like destructuring, block-structured variables, iterables, generators, and the class keyword are poised to make JavaScript programming more expressive. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00021))_

### Or even: / the simplest possible block

- There's another thing we can put to the right of an arrow, a block . A block has zero or more statements , separated by semicolons. 18 _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00210))_

- It returns the result of evaluating a block that has no statements. What would that be? Let's try it: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00213))_

### Or even: / back on the block

- We said that the function returns the result of evaluating a block , and we said that a block is a (possibly empty) list of JavaScript statements separated by semicolons. 21 _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00236))_

### And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving / nested blocks

- Up to now, we've only ever seen blocks we use as the body of functions. But there are other kinds of blocks. One of the places you can find blocks is in an if statement. In JavaScript, an if statement looks like this: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00438))_

### And also: / Building Blocks / partial application

- Another basic building block is partial application . When a function takes multiple arguments, we 'apply' the function to the arguments by evaluating it with all of the arguments, producing a value. But what if we only supply some of the arguments? In that case, we can't get the final value, but we can get a function that represents part of our application. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00591))_

### And also: / Summary / Functions

- Block bodies evaluate to whatever is returned with the return keyword, or to undefined . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00645))_

- Blocks also create scopes if const statements are within them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00649))_

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Reassignment

- Using let to bind 50 to age within the block does not change the binding of age in the outer environment because the binding of age in the block shadows the binding of age in the outer environment, just like const . We go from: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01173))_


## Technical atoms

### Technical frame 1: A Pull of the Lever: Prefaces / About JavaScript Allongé / why the 'six' edition?

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00025))_

> And the variable i is scoped locally to the code within the braces. Prior to ECMAScript 2015, JavaScript did not support block-structuring, so programmers borrowed a trick from the Scheme programming language, and would write:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00024))_

<a id="atom-technical-atom-da2e3d2bcbad5b58"></a>

```
for (int i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {
// ...
}
```

### Technical frame 2: A Pull of the Lever: Prefaces / About JavaScript Allongé / why the 'six' edition?

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00028))_

> Likewise, many programming languages permit functions to have a variable number of arguments, and to collect the arguments into a single variable as an array. In Ruby, we can write:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00026))_

<a id="atom-technical-atom-4cc33f6651c07c8e"></a>

var i;

(() => {})()

> 21 You can also separate statements with line breaks. Readers who follow internet flame-fests may be aware of something called automatic semicolon insertion. Basically, there's a step where JavaScript looks at your code and follows some rules to guess where you meant to put semicolons in should you leave them out. This feature was originally created as a kind of helpful error-correction. Some programmers argue that since it's part of the language's definition, it's fair game to write code that e

//=> undefined
(() => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 })()
//=> undefined

```

(() => { return 0 })()
//=> 0
(() => { return 1 })()
//=> 1
(() => { return 'Hello ' + 'World' })()
// 'Hello World'
```

### Technical frame 8: And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving / nested blocks

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00442))_

> The if statement is a statement, not an expression (an unfortunate design choice), and its clauses are statements or blocks. So we could also write something like:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00439))_

<a id="atom-technical-atom-179dd365e9382c9f"></a>

```
(n) => {
const even = (x) => {
if (x === 0)
return true;
else
return !even(x - 1);
}
return even(n)
}
```

### Technical frame 9: And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving / nested blocks

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00446))_

> We've used a block as the else clause, and since it's a block, we've placed a const statement inside it.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00443))_

<a id="atom-technical-atom-208e7e2794c15225"></a>

```
(n) => {
const even = (x) => {
if (x === 0)
return true;
else {
const odd = (y) => !even(y);
return odd(x - 1);
}
```

### Technical frame 10: And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving / nested blocks

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00446))_

> We've used a block as the else clause, and since it's a block, we've placed a const statement inside it.

<a id="atom-technical-atom-a4ff91c073865533"></a>

```
}
return even(n)
}
And this also works:
((n) => {
const even = (x) => {
if (x === 0)
return true;
else {
const odd = (y) => !even(y);
return odd(x - 1);
}
}
return even(n)
})(42)
```

### Technical frame 11: And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving / nested blocks

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00446))_

> We've used a block as the else clause, and since it's a block, we've placed a const statement inside it.

<a id="atom-technical-atom-4bfc4e7c5cb8ba29"></a>

```
//=> true
```

### Technical frame 12: Composing and Decomposing Data / Reassignment

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01173))_

> Using let to bind 50 to age within the block does not change the binding of age in the outer environment because the binding of age in the block shadows the binding of age in the outer environment, just like const . We go from:

```
(() => {
let age = 49;
if (true) {
let age = 50;
}
return age;
})()
//=> 49
```

### Technical frame 13: Composing and Decomposing Data / Reassignment

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01178))_

> Like evaluating variable labels, when a binding is rebound, JavaScript searches for the binding in the current environment and then each ancestor in turn until it finds one. It then rebinds the name in that environment.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01174))_

<a id="atom-technical-atom-a1d928b604590680"></a>

```

To:
{age: 50, '..': {age: 49, '..': global-environment}}
Then back to:

let age = 49;
if (true) {
age = 50;
}
return age;
})()
//=> 50
```

### Technical frame 16: Composing and Decomposing Data / Reassignment / mixing let and const / var

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01193))_

> Declaring age twice does not cause an error(!), and the inner declaration does not shadow the outer declaration. All var declarations behave as if they were hoisted to the top of the function, a little like function declarations.

Back to our function. We evaluated this:
19 Experienced JavaScript programmers are aware that there's a fourth way, using a function argument. This was actually the preferred mechanism until void became commonplace.
20 As an exercise for the reader, we suggest you ask your friendly neighbourhood programming language designer or human factors subjectmatter expert to explain why a keyword called void is used to generate an undefined value, instead of calling them both void or both undefined . We have no idea.
