# Different

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about different:

## Statements

### And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving

- Up to now, all we've really seen are anonymous functions , functions that don't have a name. This feels very different from programming in most other languages, where the focus is on naming functions, methods, and procedures. Naming things is a critical part of programming, but all we've seen so far is how to name arguments. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00385))_

### And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving / are consts also from a shadowy planet?

- We can test this by creating another conflict. But instead of binding two different variables to the same name in two different places, we'll bind two different values to the same name, but one environment will be completely enclosed by the other. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00466))_

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Mutation

- This is different. We haven't rebound the inner name to a different variable, we've mutated the value that both bindings share. Now that we've finished with mutation and aliases, let's have a look at it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01136))_

### Served by the Pot: Collections

- Some different sized and coloured coffee pots by Antti Nurmesniemi, perhaps his most known design. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01524))_


## Technical atoms

### Technical frame 1: And also: / That Constant Coffee Craving / are consts also from a shadowy planet?

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00475))_

> Now we bind 3 to PI in an otherwise empty IIFE inside of our IIFE that binds 3.14159265 to PI . Does that binding 'overwrite' the outer one? Will our function return 6 or 6.2831853 ? This is a book, you've already scanned ahead, so you know that the answer is no , the inner binding does not overwrite the outer binding:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00474))_

```
((PI) => {
((PI) => {})(3);
return (diameter) => diameter * PI;
})(3.14159265)
```

### Technical frame 2: Composing and Decomposing Data / Mutation

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01129))_

> Both halloween and allHallowsEve are bound to the same array value within the local environment. And also:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01128))_

```
const allHallowsEve = [2012, 10, 31]
const halloween = allHallowsEve;
```

### Technical atom 3

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00091))_

A different kind of language requires a different kind of book.
JavaScript holds surprising depths-its scoping rules are neither strictly lexical nor strictly dynamic, and it supports procedural, object-oriented (in several flavors!), and functional programming. Many books try to hide most of those capabilities away, giving you recipes for writing JavaScript in a way that approximates class-centric programming in other languages. Not JavaScript Allongé. It starts with the fundamentals of values, functions, and objects, and then guides you through JavaScript from the inside with exploratory bits of code that illustrate scoping, combinators, context, state, prototypes, and constructors.
