A Pull of the Lever: Prefaces

## **Forewords to the First Edition**

## **michael fogus**

As a life-long bibliophile and long-time follower of Reg’s online work, I was excited when he started writing books. However, I’m very conservative about books – let’s just say that if there was an aftershave scented to the essence of “Used Book Store” then I would be first in line to buy. So as you might imagine I was “skeptical” about the decision to release JavaScript Allongé as an ongoing ebook, with a pay-what-you-want model. However, Reg sent me a copy of his book and I was humbled. Not only was this a great book, but it was also a great way to write and distribute books. Having written books myself, I know the pain of soliciting and receiving feedback.

The act of writing is an iterative process with (very often) tight revision loops. However, the process of soliciting feedback, gathering responses, sending out copies, waiting for people to actually read it (if they ever do), receiving feedback and then ultimately making sense out of how to use it takes weeks and sometimes months. On more than one occasion I’ve found myself attempting to reify feedback with content that either no longer existed or was changed beyond recognition. However, with the Leanpub model the read-feedback-change process is extremely efficient, leaving in its wake a quality book that continues to get better as others likewise read and comment into infinitude.

In the case of JavaScript Allongé, you’ll find the Leanpub model a shining example of effectiveness. Reg has crafted (and continues to craft) not only an interesting book from the perspective of a connoisseur, but also an entertaining exploration into some of the most interesting aspects of his art. No matter how much of an expert you think you are, JavaScript Allongé has something to teach you… about coffee. I kid.

As a staunch advocate of functional programming, much of what Reg has written rings true to me. While not exclusively a book about functional programming, JavaScript Allongé will provide a solid foundation for functional techniques. However, you’ll not be beaten about the head and neck with dogma. Instead, every section is motivated by relevant dialog and fortified with compelling source examples. As an author of programming books I admire what Reg has managed to accomplish and I envy the fine reader who finds JavaScript Allongé via some darkened channel in the Internet sprawl and reads it for the first time.

Enjoy.

A different kind of language requires a different kind of book.

JavaScript holds surprising depths–its scoping rules are neither strictly lexical nor strictly dynamic, and it supports procedural, object-oriented (in several flavors!), and functional programming. Many

### That Constant Coffee Craving

- The first sip: Basic Functions

## **That Constant Coffee Craving**

Up to now, all we’ve really seen are _anonymous functions_ , functions that don’t have a name. This feels very different from programming in most other languages, where the focus is on naming functions, methods, and procedures. Naming things is a critical part of programming, but all we’ve seen so far is how to name arguments.

There are other ways to name things in JavaScript, but before we learn some of those, let’s see how to use what we already have to name things. Let’s revisit a very simple example: (diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265

What is this “3.14159265” number? PI[28] , obviously. We’d like to name it so that we can write something like: (diameter) => diameter * PI

In order to bind 3.14159265 to the name PI, we’ll need a function with a parameter of PI applied to an argument of 3.14159265. If we put our function expression in parentheses, we can apply it to the argument of 3.14159265:

((PI) => _// ????_ )(3.14159265) What do we put inside our new function that binds 3.14159265 to the name PI when evaluated? Our circumference function, of course:

((PI) => (diameter) => diameter * PI )(3.14159265) This expression, when evaluated, returns a function that calculates circumferences. That sounds bad, but when we think about it, (diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265 is also an expression, that when evaluated, returns a function that calculates circumferences. All of our “functions” are expressions. This one has a few more moving parts, that’s all. But we can use it just like (diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265.

Let’s test it:

The first sip: Basic Functions ((diameter_fn) => { **const** PI = 3; **return** diameter_fn(2) })( (() => { **const** PI = 3.14159265; **return** (diameter) => diameter * PI })() ) _//=> 6.2831853_

Yes. Binding values to names with const works just like binding values to names with parameter invocations, it uses lexical scope.

## **are consts also from a shadowy planet?**

We just saw that values bound with const use lexical scope, just like values bound with parameters. They are looked up in the environment where they are declared. And we know that functions create environments. Parameters are declared when we create functions, so it makes sense that parameters are bound to environments created when we invoke functions.

But const statements can appear inside blocks, and we saw that blocks can appear inside of other blocks, including function bodies. So where are const variables bound? In the function environment? Or in an environment corresponding to the block?

We can test this by creating another conflict. But instead of binding two different variables to the same name in two different places, we’ll bind two different values to the same name, but one environment will be completely enclosed by the other.

Let’s start, as above, by doing this with parameters. We’ll start with:

((PI) => (diameter) => diameter * PI )(3.14159265) And gratuitously wrap it in another IIFE so that we can bind PI to something else: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-83ecb080-00070))_

### Mutation

- Composing and Decomposing Data

120 **const** allHallowsEve = [2012, 10, 31]; ( **function** (halloween) { halloween = [2013, 10, 31]; })(allHallowsEve); allHallowsEve _//=> [2012, 10, 31]_ The outer value of allHallowsEve was not changed because all we did was rebind the name halloween within the inner environment. However, what happens if we _mutate_ the value in the inner environment?

**const** allHallowsEve = [2012, 10, 31]; ( **function** (halloween) { halloween[0] = 2013; })(allHallowsEve); allHallowsEve _//=> [2013, 10, 31]_ This is different. We haven’t rebound the inner name to a different variable, we’ve mutated the value that both bindings share. Now that we’ve finished with mutation and aliases, let’s have a look at it.

**==> picture [29 x 29] intentionally omitted <==**

JavaScript permits the reassignment of new values to existing bindings, as well as the reassignment and assignment of new values to elements of containers such as arrays and objects. Mutating existing objects has special implications when two bindings are aliases of the same value.

**==> picture [29 x 29] intentionally omitted <==**

Note well: Declaring a variable const does not prevent us from mutating its value, only from rebinding its name. This is an important distinction.

## **mutation and data structures**

Mutation is a surprisingly complex subject. It is possible to compute anything without ever mutating an existing entity. Languages like Haskell[70] don’t permit mutation at all. In general, mutation makes some algorithms shorter to write and possibly faster, but harder to reason about.

One pattern many people follow is to be liberal with mutation when constructing data, but conservative with mutation when consuming data. Let’s recall linked lists from Plain Old JavaScript Objects. While we’re executing the mapWith function, we’re constructing a new linked list. By this pattern, we would be happy to use mutation to construct the list while running mapWith.

But after returning the new list, we then become conservative about mutation. This also makes sense: Linked lists often use structure sharing. For example:
