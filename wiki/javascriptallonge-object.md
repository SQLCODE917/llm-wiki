# Object

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about object:

## Statements

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Plain Old JavaScript Objects

- In JavaScript, an object is a map from string keys to values. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01070))_

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Mutation

- In JavaScript, almost every type of value can mutate . Their identities stay the same, but not their structure. Specifically, arrays and objects can mutate. Recall that you can access a value from within an array or an object using [] . You can reassign a value using [] = : _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01121))_

- JavaScript permits the reassignment of new values to existing bindings, as well as the reassignment and assignment of new values to elements of containers such as arrays and objects. Mutating existing objects has special implications when two bindings are aliases of the same value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01138))_

### Served by the Pot: Collections / Iteration and Iterables

- Many objects in JavaScript can model collections of things. A collection is like a box containing stuff. Sometimes you just want to move the box around. But sometimes you want to open it up and do things with its contents. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01528))_

### Served by the Pot: Collections / Iteration and Iterables / iterator objects

- Iteration for functions and objects has been around for many, many decades. For simple linear collections like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, functional iterators are the simplest and easiest way to implement iterators. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01546))_

- In programs involving large collections of objects, it can be handy to implement iterators as objects, rather than functions. The mechanics of iterating can then be factored using the same tools that are used to factor the mechanics of all other objects in the system. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01547))_

- Fortunately, an iterator object is almost as simple as an iterator function. Instead of having a function that you call to get the next element, you have an object with a .next() method. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01548))_

### Like this:

- Now our .iterator() method is returning an iterator object. When working with objects, we do things the object way. But having started by building functional iterators, we understand what is happening underneath the object's scaffolding. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01552))_

### Like this: / iterables

- The expression Symbol.iterator evaluates to a special symbol representing the name of the method that objects should use if they return an iterator object. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01557))_

- The for...of loop works directly with any object that is iterable , meaning it works with any object that has a Symbol.iterator method that returns an object iterator. Here's another linked list, this one is iterable: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01562))_

### Like this: / Generating Iterables

- Let's consider how they work. Whether it's a simple functional iterator, or an iterable object with a .next() method, an iterator is something we call repeatedly until it tells us that it's done. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01626))_

### We'll keep it simple: / generators and iterables

- This object declares a [Symbol.iterator] function that makes it iterable. Because it's declared *[Symbol.iterator] , it's a generator instead of an iterator. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01714))_

### We'll keep it simple: / Summary

- A generator is a function that is defined with function * and uses yield (or yield * ) to generate values. Using a generator instead of writing an iterator object that has a .next() method allows us to write code that can be much simpler for cases like recursive iterations or state patterns. And we don't need to worry about wrapping our values in an object with .done and .value properties. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01759))_

### We'll keep it simple: / Lazy and Eager Collections

- in the older style of object-oriented programming, we built 'fat' objects. Each collection knew how to map itself ( .map ), how to fold itself ( .reduce ), how to filter itself ( .filter ) and how to find one element within itself ( .find ). If we wanted to flatten collections to arrays, we wrote a .toArray method for each type of collection. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01764))_

- This 'fat object' style springs from a misunderstanding: When we say a collection should know how to perform a map over itself, we don't need for the collection to handle every single detail. That would be like saying that when we ask a bank teller for some cash, they personally print every bank note. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01767))_

### We'll keep it simple: / Lazy and Eager Collections / implementing methods with iteration

- Object-oriented collections should definitely have methods for mapping, reducing, filtering, and finding. And they should know how to accomplish the desired result, but they should do so by delegating as much of the work as possible to operations like mapWith . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01769))_

### We'll keep it simple: / Lazy and Eager Collections / lazy collection operations

- Whereas the .map and .filter methods on Pair work with iterators. They produce small iterable objects that refer back to the original iteration. This reduces the memory footprint. When working with very large collections and many operations, this can be important. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01788))_


## Technical atoms

### Technical frame 1: Composing and Decomposing Data / Plain Old JavaScript Objects / literal object syntax

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01077))_

> Values contained within an object work just like values contained within an array, we access them by reference to the original:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01074))_

```
{ year: 2012, month: 6, day: 14 }
```

### Technical frame 2: Composing and Decomposing Data / Plain Old JavaScript Objects / literal object syntax

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01077))_

> Values contained within an object work just like values contained within an array, we access them by reference to the original:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01076))_

```
{ year: 2012, month: 6, day: 14 } === { year: 2012, month: 6, day: 14 }
//=> false
Objects use [] to access the values by name, using a string:
{ year: 2012, month: 6, day: 14 }['day']
//=> 14
```

### Technical frame 3: Composing and Decomposing Data / Plain Old JavaScript Objects / literal object syntax

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01079))_

> Names needn't be alphanumeric strings. For anything else, enclose the label in quotes:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01078))_

```
const unique = () => [],
x = unique(),
y = unique(),
z = unique(),
o = { a: x, b: y, c: z };
o['a'] === x && o['b'] === y && o['c'] === z
//=> true
```

### Technical frame 4: Composing and Decomposing Data / Plain Old JavaScript Objects / literal object syntax

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01091))_

> It is very common to associate named function expressions with keys in objects, and there is a 'compact method syntax' for binding named function expressions to keywords:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01092))_

```
const SecretDecoderRing = {
encode (plaintext) {
return plaintext
.split('')
.map( char => char.charCodeAt() )
.map( code => code + 1 )
.map( code => String.fromCharCode(code) )
.join('');
},
decode (cyphertext) {
return cyphertext
.split('')
.map( char => char.charCodeAt() )
.map( code => code - 1 )
.map( code => String.fromCharCode(code) )
.join('');
}
}
```

### Technical frame 5: Composing and Decomposing Data / Plain Old JavaScript Objects / destructuring objects

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01100))_

> Terrible grammar and capitalization, but let's move on. It is very common to write things like title: title when destructuring objects. When the label is a valid variable name, it's often the most obvious variable name as well. So JavaScript supports a further syntactic optimization:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01096))_

```
const user = {
name: { first: "Reginald",
last: "Braithwaite"
},
occupation: { title: "Author",
responsibilities: [ "JavaScript Allongé",
"JavaScript Spessore",
"CoffeeScript Ristretto"
]
}
};
user.name.last
//=> "Braithwaite"
user.occupation.title
//=> "Author"
And we can also write:
const {name: { first: given, last: surname}, occupation: { title: title }
er;
surname
//=> "Braithwaite"
title
//=> "Author"
```

### Technical frame 6: Composing and Decomposing Data / Plain Old JavaScript Objects / destructuring objects

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01100))_

> Terrible grammar and capitalization, but let's move on. It is very common to write things like title: title when destructuring objects. When the label is a valid variable name, it's often the most obvious variable name as well. So JavaScript supports a further syntactic optimization:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01101))_

```
const description = ({name: { first }, occupation: { title } }) =>
`${first} is a ${title}`;
description(user)
//=> "Reginald is a Author"
And that same syntax works for literals:
const abbrev = ({name: { first, last }, occupation: { title } }) => {
```

### Technical frame 7: Composing and Decomposing Data / Plain Old JavaScript Objects / destructuring objects

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01100))_

return { first, last, title};
}
abbrev(user)
//=> {"first":"Reginald","last":"Braithwaite","title":"Author"}
```

### Technical frame 8: Composing and Decomposing Data / Plain Old JavaScript Objects / revisiting linked lists

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01109))_

> What about mapping? Well, let's start with the simplest possible thing, making a copy of a list. As we saw above, and discussed in Garbage, Garbage Everywhere, it is fast to iterate forward through a linked list. What isn't fast is naïvely copying a list:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01107))_

```
In that case, a linked list of the numbers 1, 2, and 3 will look like this: { first: 1, rest: { first:
2, rest: { first: 3, rest: EMPTY } } }.
We can then perform the equivalent of [first, ...rest] with direct property accessors:
```

### Technical frame 9: Composing and Decomposing Data / Plain Old JavaScript Objects / revisiting linked lists

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01109))_

const EMPTY = {};
const OneTwoThree = { first: 1, rest: { first: 2, rest: { first: 3, rest: EMPTY \
} } };
OneTwoThree.first
//=> 1
OneTwoThree.rest
//=> {"first":2,"rest":{"first":3,"rest":{}}}
OneTwoThree.rest.rest.first
//=> 3
Taking the length of a linked list is easy:
const length = (node, delayed = 0) =>
node === EMPTY
? delayed
: length(node.rest, delayed + 1);
length(OneTwoThree)
//=> 3
```

### Technical frame 10: Composing and Decomposing Data / Mutation

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01127))_

> Wehave established that JavaScript's semantics allow for two different bindings to refer to the same value. For example:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01122))_

```
const oneTwoThree = [1, 2, 3];
oneTwoThree[0] = 'one';
oneTwoThree
//=> [ 'one', 2, 3 ]
```

name.middleName = 'Austin'
name

> If we write a program with the presumption that 'everything is an object,' we can write maps, folds, and filters that work on objects. We just ask the object for an iterator, and work on the iterator. Our functions don't need to know anything about how an object implements iteration, and we get the benefit of lazily traversing our objects.

> Well, we've written our iterator as a server . It waits until given a request, and then it returns exactly one item. Then it waits for the next request.

A different kind of language requires a different kind of book.
JavaScript holds surprising depths-its scoping rules are neither strictly lexical nor strictly dynamic, and it supports procedural, object-oriented (in several flavors!), and functional programming. Many books try to hide most of those capabilities away, giving you recipes for writing JavaScript in a way that approximates class-centric programming in other languages. Not JavaScript Allongé. It starts with the fundamentals of values, functions, and objects, and then guides you through JavaScript from the inside with exploratory bits of code that illustrate scoping, combinators, context, state, prototypes, and constructors.
