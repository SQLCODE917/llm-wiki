## Statements

- Our generator function oneTwoThree is not an iterator. It's a function that returns an iterator when we invoke it. We write the function to yield values instead of return a single value, and JavaScript takes care of turning this into an object with a .next() function we can call. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01708))_
- If we call our generator function more than once, we get new iterators. As we saw above, we called oneTwoThree three times, and each time we got an iterator that begins at 1 and counts to 3 . Recalling the way we wrote ordered collections, we could make a collection that uses a generator function: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01709))_
- This pattern is encouraged, so much so that JavaScript provides a concise syntax for writing generator methods for objects: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01712))_
- This object declares a [Symbol.iterator] function that makes it iterable. Because it's declared *[Symbol.iterator] , it's a generator instead of an iterator. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01714))_
- So to summarize, ThreeNumbers is an object that we've made iterable, by way of writing a generator method for [Symbol.iterator] . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01715))_
- Because it's declared *[Symbol.iterator] , it's a generator instead of an iterator. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01714))_
