## Statements

- JavaScript does not permit us to rebind a name that has been bound with const . We can shadow it by using const to declare a new binding with a new function or block scope, but we cannot rebind a name that was bound with const in an existing scope. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00496))_
- This is valuable, as it greatly simplifies the analysis of programs to see at a glance that when something is bound with const , we need never worry that its value may change. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00497))_
