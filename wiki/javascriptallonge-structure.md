# Structure

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about structure:

## Statements

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Self-Similarity

- Let's be more specific. Some data structures, like lists, can obviously be seen as a collection of items. Some are empty, some have three items, some forty-two, some contain numbers, some contain strings, some a mixture of elements, there are all kinds of lists. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00886))_

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Garbage, Garbage Everywhere / some history

- Again, it's just extracting a reference from a cons cell, it's very fast. In Lisp, it's blazingly fast because it happens in hardware. There's no making copies of arrays, the time to cdr a list with five elements is the same as the time to cdr a list with 5,000 elements, and no temporary arrays are needed. In JavaScript, it's still much, much, much faster to get all the elements except the head from a linked list than from an array. Getting one reference to a structure that already exists is faster than copying a bunch of elements. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01047))_

### Yes. Consider this variation: / Functional Iterators

- What we've done is turn an array into a function that folds an array with const foldArray = (array) => callRight(foldArrayWith, array); . The sumFoldable function doesn't care what kind of data structure we have, as long as it's foldable. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01280))_

### Yes. Consider this variation: / Making Data Out Of Functions / backwardness

- Our latin data structure is no longer a dumb data structure, it's a function. And instead of passing latin to first or second , we pass first or second to latin . It's exactly backwards of the way we write functions that operate on data. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01362))_

```
cdr(oneToFive)
//=> [2,[3,[4,[5,null]]]]
```

### Technical frame 2: Yes. Consider this variation: / Functional Iterators / iterating

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01295))_

> We can write a different iterator for a different data structure. Here's one for linked lists:

```
const EMPTY = null;
const isEmpty = (node) => node === EMPTY;
const pair = (first, rest = EMPTY) => ({first, rest});
const list = (...elements) => {
const [first, ...rest] = elements;
return elements.length === 0
? EMPTY
: pair(first, list(...rest))
}
const print = (aPair) =>
isEmpty(aPair)
? ""
: `${aPair.first} ${print(aPair.rest)}`
const listIterator = (aPair) =>
() => {
const done = isEmpty(aPair);
if (done) {
return {done};
}
else {
const {first, rest} = aPair;
aPair = aPair.rest;
```

return { done, value: first }
}
}
const iteratorSum = (iterator) => {
let eachIteration,
sum = 0;;
while ((eachIteration = iterator(), !eachIteration.done)) {
sum += eachIteration.value;
}
return sum
}
const aListIterator = listIterator(list(1, 4, 9, 16, 25));
iteratorSum(aListIterator)
//=> 55
