## Statements

- Wekeep using the same pattern in our functions: aPair === EMPTY ? doSomething : doSomethingElse . This follows the philosophy we used with data structures: The function doing the work inspects the data structure. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01389))_
- We can reverse this: Instead of asking a pair if it is empty and then deciding what to do, we can ask the pair to do it for us. Here's length again: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01390))_
- Now we'll need to write first and rest functions for a list, and those names will collide with the first and rest we wrote for pairs. So let's disambiguate our names: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01394))_
- We can write reverse and mapWith as well. We aren't being super-strict about emulating combinatory logic, we'll use default parameters: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01397))_
- We have managed to provide the exact same functionality that === and ?: provided, but using functions and nothing else. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01399))_
- We can reverse this: Instead of asking a pair if it is empty and then deciding what to do, we can ask the pair to do it for us. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-01390))_
