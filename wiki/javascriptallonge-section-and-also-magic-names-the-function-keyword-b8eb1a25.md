## Statements

- There are two separate rules for these 'magic' names, one for when you invoke a function using the function keyword, and another for functions defined with 'fat arrows.' We'll begin with how things work for functions defined with the function keyword. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00607))_
- The first magic name is this , and it is bound to something called the function's context. We will explore this in more detail when we start discussing objects and classes. The second magic name is very interesting, it's called arguments , and the most interesting thing about it is that it contains a list of arguments passed to a function: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00608))_
- arguments always contains all of the arguments passed to a function, regardless of how many are declared. Therefore, we can write plus like this: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00612))_
- The most common use of the arguments binding is to build functions that can take a variable number of arguments. We'll see it used in many of the recipes, starting off with partial application and ellipses. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-7239e085-00617))_
