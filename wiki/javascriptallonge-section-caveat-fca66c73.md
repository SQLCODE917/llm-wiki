# caveat

From [[javascriptallonge]].

## Statements

- Please note that unlike most of the other functions discussed in this book, iterators are stateful . There are some important implications of stateful functions. One is that while functions like take(...) appear to create an entirely new iterator, in reality they return a decorated reference to the original iterator. So as you traverse the new decorator, you're changing the state of the original! _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01322))_
- For all intents and purposes, once you pass an iterator to a function, you can expect that you no longer 'own' that iterator, and that its state either has changed or will change. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01323))_
